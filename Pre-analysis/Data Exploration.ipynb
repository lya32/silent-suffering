With hindsight I should never really have come off it but stayed at a very low dose . I spent hours..again ...researching the internet in the early stages. This time it took 6 weeks until I started to feel better. It had taken only 2 the first time Yes I had all the side effects and felt much much worse whilst my brain waited to rewire  itself in those initial weeks It may not be the drug for everyone but it's worked wonders for me  So I just wanted to comfort and give empathy to those of you out there who are still on their journey My path is now much straighter Good luck all \\n\\nHi Gillian I read your posts which really encourages me so thank you. I have been on 20mg of Cit for three weeks now, was on 10 for a year after dropping from 20 as I felt I could , silly mistake! I came crashing down 3 weeks ago after starting a new job, anxiety in the mornings is driving me insane and then really flat all day , can't wait to sleep but get anxious about waking up knowing the anxiety will be there! Any idea how much longer it will take for the Cit to stop the anxiety? I just want to be me again , get out of the house and get on with my life ! Thank you\\nHi Gillian I am not nearly at 5 weeks on 20mg Cit (Saturday is 5 weeks not that I'm counting!) side effects just about gone now and I have been out walking the last 4 days , hadn't left my bed for 3 weeks before that , morning anxiety is still a big issue very unpleasant but generally lifts by the afternoon and evening in fact I have felt pretty good the last couple of evenings. Still waking up very early and can't get back to sleep but I'm sure that will improve too. Will need a couple more weeks off work and hope they hold my job for me , it's a new job so still in probation period. Keep telling myself I will get back to ME but it's hard to see it ! Defo making progress and have an appointment today with a councillor for an assessment, that's making me anxious 😩. But all in all I am getting better and sticking with Cit was the right thing to do. Thanks for your encouragement it really helps me.\\n\\nHi, I realise this is an old post but I was wondering how things are now? Better? I am on week 4 and although I am considerably better in relation to the start of this all .... I have the same issue with morning anxiety and throughout the day. For no apparent reason, which is so much more frustrating. I’m not giving up hope but I still struggle with the feeling of “is this ever going to stop”  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\\n\\nHey rachel77333,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the sleeping algorithms I’m not sure I think that was someone else. I do recall the 54321 take action which is the 5 Second Rule by Mel Robbins. Highly recommend her story.\\nAudiobooks that really helped me get through the tough times and build a foundation of behavioral strength and tools to lean on in collaboration with the medication are:  Freedom of Nervous Suffering  and Hope &amp; Help for your Nerves by Dr  Claire Weekes Anxious for Nothing &amp; God Will Carry you Theough by Max Lucado The Energy Bus by Jon Gordon  The Greatness within You by Les Brown Being In Light by Marianne Williamson The Happiness Advantage by Shawn Achor\\n\\nHI just seen your post, how are you getting on, are you still on Citalopram\\nHI I am on 10mg week 4, still not feeling well\\nHi I'm on 10 MG Celexa going on 3 weeks after being on different MG Celexa over 11 month , long story . Just got down from 20 MG after being  on it for 5 month with high  anxiety  and bad side effects.  So we decided to go down to 10 MG . My side effects got less but still have anxiety and crying spells is that normal ?  I still get headaches,  nausea,  shakes and so on . They come in the morning really strong then lessened though the day . So I got on this medicine put on because I was sick , with being sick came anxiety and  depression\\nThanks for your success story in the same and yes I felt my best after 3 months and are now 4 months down the line and feel back to normal and still in 15mg\\nI'm so pleased to hear that you're feeling so much better gillian .  It took me from August to January to feel good again and finally got back to work.  Still can't believe what a nightmare it's all been !\\nHi Gerrymoo, i'm just coming up to 3 months on 20 mg Citalopram and still feeling pretty bad.  When did you start to feel better and in what way? Would very much appreciate your feedback as I'm worried these are not this is not the right medicine for me.\\nHi Anna, briefly with no past history I was hit with a sudden wall of  anxiety  last summer , cutting a very long story short I started 10mg citalopram which was increased to 20mg 3 wks later.  I had terrible side effects both on   10mg and then increasing to 20mg.  Increased anxiety made me think I was going out of my mind. Combined with nausea and insomnia made life pretty miserable. I just felt exhausted and lost about two and half stone . Gradually from going through every awful day to having better spells towards evening, life started improving.  I felt a notice improvement towards Christmas and a definite improvement mid January.   Strangely enough the sudden improvement followed a blip in which I was advised to go up to 30mg.  I didn't, I prayed it was a blip.and it was.  Valium and the support from this forum got me through such a terrible time! .. I'm back at work fully now and coping in a very busy stressful environment, hang on in there Anna.  Are you having some good days or parts of a day?  If so then it's obviously starting to work .  It's so hard\\nThanks so much for getting back to me.  It gives me hope that it took a while for you to recover.  I have had good days but not recently (last 2 weeks have been tough) but yes, I usually feel better in the evenings and a couple of weekends ago I thought I was ok again. Glad to hear you're back at work and you've put this ordeal behind you. Hopefully this is just a blip I'm having before an improvement.\\nHi gerrymoo  How long were young off work for?   How did you feel about returning?  I am aiming to get back next week after sick leave. Working wasn't the cause but certainly didn't help. Things are sorted now.\\nHi Zoe, I was off for 5 months in total- a long time!  It's a strange  one  really because I love my job añd although it's very demanding both physically and mentally I never believed it was the cause of my anxiety.  However, I had been pretty well over Christmas and then had a horrible blip 1st week in january and had an appt with my GP who signed me off another month and told me to increase the dose to 30mg.\\nI've been off 10weeks.  If having a phased return too.  I just don't like the thought of returning and not being 100%. I know that being off work now is not helping my recovery and that I will feel better once in there.  I thank me confidence has just had a knock.\\n\\nAs it said previously I know my anxiety is going to ramping ⤴ with the thought of going back to work. Hey-ho it is!! I really want to go back and know that by working I well have less time to ruminate.  I have put everything in place to make the first day as stress free as I can but it just so nervous.  Any advice to prepare please?\\nHow are you feeling now?  Just wondering, since it has been a little over a month since your last post.  I was upped dosages pretty quickly on this medicine and going to talk to my GP today.  I went from 10 to 20 to 40 within three weeks.  So it has been a lot of fun with the side effects\\n\\nHow long before you started feeling better?\\n\\nThat's good to hear. I'm on week 6 and still finding it very hard to get out of bed and motivate myself. Also negative thoughts keep taking over.\\nHope things are looking up for you! SHANE\\n\\n\\nI'm at 6 weeks too. Have not seen any improvement.  Around week 4, I did think I was getting better, but here lately it's been back to the way it used to be before I started.  I'm on 20mgs of cit. I'm trying to stick it out hoping it will get better. My morning are bad and I get things on my mind and can't get them off.\\n\\n\\nThank you so much! I need the encouragement! I am going to hang in there!👍\\nThank you for your reply! I just want to feel like myself again.  I'm hanging in there! Hopefully this will work!  Maybe I should say, this WILL work!\\nI so agree with Gillian. I've 2 books recommended by my therapist. Mind over Mood and The 5 Second Rule.  Basically we cannot allow our feelings, our emotions dictate our actions. We may not feel like getting out of bed, we may not feel like going for a walk or eating healthy but we need count down in our heads 5,4,3,2,1 and when we hit 1 get up and do what we need to do. It's hard. You won't like it at first but overtime it works. You retrain your brain by your actions. You can't think your way out of anxiety. You have to take action.

I'm over 4 months in and yes I feel good too and do have the odd off day but that's ok I'm moving forward. I'm on 15mg and di want to go to just 10 but just seen that 29 is the thereputic dose so maybe stay where I am for now Life is good once you get through the tunnel to the other side\\n\\nHi\\n\\n\\n\\nShane\\n\\nIt's good to hear a positive story. I was on citalopram for years and was mainly fine, so I reduced them due to hunger issues. About a month ago I crashed badly, I have been back on them for a few weeks (just over 2 weeks at 20mg). I felt better last week, back at work, almost normal. Feel worse again this week, depressed and feel like part of my personality is missing\\nI've been on 10mg for 3 wks now and wonder when I'll start to feel myself again.\\n\\nYes I saw that. It's just dissapointing as I began to feel ok last week but feel rubbish again, was crying last night. But I did have a stressful day on Monday. I just hope I don't need to up the dose as I worry about the hunger coming back.\\n\\nHi, I'm on 20mg, was on 10mg for 10 days. Side effects were a bit of diarrhea and  dry mouth . Increased  anxiety  and  depression . Physical side effects have gone now but I'm ot feeling great this week.\\n\\nI don't think so, pretty much the same.\\nThank you I'm going to start on 20 tomoro\\nHow are you feeling?  I'm quite up and down at the moment. Sometimes I can feel completely normal again and then I can feel quite low and weepy or just not myself. Hoping this is normal and will eventually iron out.\\nHey Nicola,\\nHi Elliot Thanks so much for your encouraging words. It is so hard to remember when you are feeling bad. At each stage of improvement I feel like 'this is going to be it forever' and I never learn but I need to acknowledge that it is improvement. I have been writing a journal to help me look back and see how bad I was. I feel fine now, I usually feel fine from lunchtime but 'off' in the mornings.\\n\\nI take it at night, which is what I did the last time I was on it. It was making me very sleepy when I first started and I don't have any problems sleeping on it.\\n\\n\\nHi Gillian I was out on 10mg for 2 wks but I was giving 20on Monday but scared to take it.i spoke to doctor today and she says go up to 20 tomoro because it's more therapeutic.\\n\\nup till now but said he felt awful last night having morbid thoughts, Panicky..and  anxiety  worse,dont know wether to wring Drs tomorrow or what..\\nTell him to hang in in there and take one day at a time - worst of the side effects are usually out of the way around 2 weeks but the full benefit of citalopram can vary with different people which is usually measured in months. Good luck\\nBut started getting low,so she put him on Citalapran 20mg  i am so  Worried about him hes lost 2 stone ,gets a feeling in is stomach cant Eat ,never been poorly in his life ,never had a day off work..he was put\\nHi, like Gillian days you will get lots of advice, personal stories and lots of support on this forums.  Try not to dwell on things and look forward to better times ahead.  Personally I lost 2.5 stone last year and everyone on here will tell you that they've been through hell to get to the other side but good times lay ahead.  Try and get him to manage healthy food, meditation and  mindfulness  really helped me too.\\n\\nHi Gillian You wanted me to repost this post under here about 'Reason why meds take so long and why you feel rubbish'  Be warned folks ...... its a l-o-n-g post  Hi everyone, here’s something I found online which you may find intersting.  Its about why you feel so rubbish when taking these meds, why your mood is up and down, why it takes so long and the process it all goes through. Sorry its a long post. When starting an SSRI or increasing it's dose often makes people feel really rubbish, which can cause a great deal of stress as you begin to wonder whats happening, why is their illness getting worse, are these meds working etc. Somone recently posted a great post explaining what these meds do in our brains, and I’d like to add further to this.  So, as already posted ….. the brain is basically a big dense bundle of nerves which carry electrical signals around our brain and body.  The nerve cells don’t touch each other, leaving a small gap between each cell, called a synapse.  So how do signals get from one nerve to another? Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by nerve cells that tell a neighbouring nerve cell to pass the signal along.  A bit like pass the parcel.  Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter.   So when an electrical signal reaches the end of a nerve cell that deals with serotonin, that cell releases serotonin into the gap (synapse), which then crosses the gap and interacts with the nearby nerve cell and tells it to pass the signal along. Once the serotonin has done it's job, the serotonin is then reabsorbed from the gap so that no more signals are passed until the next one comes down the nerve.  SSRIs, (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) interfere with this reabsorbtion process and thus it stays in the gap longer, which equates to more serotonin and more signals. So furthering on from there ….. why do you feel so rubbish? So, along with the releasing of serotonin, and reabsorbing it, nerve cells also have parts that detect an increase in serotonin level and tell the nerve cell to stop producing anymore serotonin until the level drops.  These are called autoreceptors, which are the reason you feel like so rubbish. So the SSRI will increase the amount of serotonin that’s gathered in the synapses between nerve cells, but unfortunately the autoreceptors of the nerve cell pick up on this increase and tell the nerve cell to stop producing serotonin.  The result of this is that when you first start taking an SSRI your serotonin levels drop. How do they go up again? Eventually with continuous use of the SSRI medication, the autoreceptors become desensitised, that is to say they've continually told the nerve cell to stop producing serotonin but yet serotonin is still there.  In short they simply give up.  They stop telling the nerve cell to stop producing serotonin and your serotonin levels start to increase. This desensitisation takes time, it doesn't happen over night and it won't even begin to happen until the SSRI levels have stabilised.  This is why you feel so rubbish, and is why your mood drops and your anxiety increases (also fuelledd by the fear of not knowing whats going on).  Your mood will be up and down as the seronotin continues to try to stablise. So, to summarise: SSRIs cause your serotonin levels to drop when you first start taking them.  Your serotonin levels will not rise until the autoreceptors in your brain have stopped working (become desensitised), all of which takes lots and lots of time.  Everyone is different, so for some it can be many weeks and other months. I hope this helps some people to understand what these meds are doing and why you don't get instant results, compared to other meds that work in different ways which is the reason they can have a more immediate effects (benzos for example).\\n\\nHow are you now?\\nIt could be weeks or months till he feels better,he frightened he want be ever be able to go back to work Hes only been on them 4 days , l feel sorry for him hes such a strong man\\nHi merry Christmas.

Hope you see this as I am afraid to go back on after being off for 8 months. Long story short, they worked for me for years then stopped working, doc upped the dose and they worked again, and then stopped working, so I went cold turkey. It's been hell. Want to reinstate but have read it can make it all worse. Your story makes me feel better about going back on them. Just wondering about your reinstatement dose and how long between not taking and reinstating. Thanks so much.\\nHi there! Well I was only off them very briefly in 2000. Then went straight back on the 20mgs. So I've been on 20mgs for 17 years and they have kept me going. So 4 weeks ago I had to have hem upped to 40mgs due to moving house, job etc and it kicked everything off. Not been like this for 17 years!!  I'm still quite anxious and getting up in the morning is a struggle..  But hopefully the next couple of weeks they will start to work. I hate this feeling so much as I feel like it's such an effort to just get through the day.  Keep in touch and let me know how you get on.\\n\\nHi nicola99452 May I ask what the name of the antihistamine  was\\nBy wednesday  dry mouth  and edgie thursday and friday suicidal thoughts Wrang drs said stay on them but if to bad come off them, Saturday fine my Old husband back till dinner time went right down,we ended up at crisis health Center,they spoke for two hours to him dr explained about citalopran ,Sunday Morning he woke up frightened to death,couldnt see a way out of this ,crying sweating Shaking suicidal,got up didnt take cit till dinner felt bad this morning but not as bad as yesterday\\nHi Merry Christmas  Sorry to hear things have been really rough for you both.  Your husband really needs to take the citalopram at the same time every day.  It's really important to keep the levels steady in his system rather than taking it erratically.  Had he got some diazepam to help with the  anxiety /panics.  It was a life saver for me. Gerry\\nHi Merry Christmas. I'm sorry to hear he's having such a rough time, It takes somebody to be very brave to admit that they are having suicidal thoughts but I can't stress the importance enough of taking your citalopram at the same time everyday. You need to be really strict with this, He's only making it harder for himself. What you should both focus on is that infact he had a good day on saturday, and try not to get disheartened that It only lasted a small amount of time, those days will get easier. By Day 7 I was ready to throw in the towel, but now I'm on Day 16 and extremely glad I didn't. Your husband needs to talk to somebody regarding the thought's hes having to ensure he understands what is happening. I doubt that your husband is actually suicidal, I certainly know I had suicidal thoughts during the worst part of citalopram but when your at that level of anxious its very easy to confuse the fear of becoming suicidal/not being able to cope with that of being suicidal. This will get better, I'm looking forward to hearing about his recovery in the coming weeks. I understand that as a man, my natural reaction is to \"help myself get better\". I'm absolutely work motivated and terrible when I'm off for anything, being Anxiety only makes that worse due to the nature of the illness. I want your husband to know that I've been through what he is experiencing, He might not believe me but what he is experiencing is most definetly temporary, and you can 100% blame the Citalopram for it because It's scientifically proven that these drugs make you feel worse before they make you feel better. Can I suggest that you look into a book called \"DARE\", Its available on Amazon Prime and I found it really helped me understand and cope with the first few weeks, and It's also extremely therapeutic to read about the techniques you can use to help yourself recover.  Your husband most likely will be struggling to \"keep busy\" at the moment, so the bad days probably feel like they are going to last forever. I think its really important that you continue to do gentle activities when in your worst state, This won't be easy but I utilised the mentalityy \"Well I feel so bad so this really can't make me feel any worse so why the hell not\". Gentle walks, watching a funny TV show, visiting close family and friends who can offer support, Drawing.  Please take the tablet at the same time everyday, I don't sleep well with them at the start so I take them in the morning with Breakfast. Have a look at MIND mental health charity to see if they can support your husband in the early days of this medication. Progress is going to be slow, and there is going to be setbacks but he needs to keep reminding himself that this is a Temporary Problem caused by his body's inability to calibrate to the drugs any quicker. When I felt awful last week, I told myself this statement probably over 500 times a day just to put things into perspective. All the best.\\ning words ,he has felt abit better since yesterday afternoon, bit frightened this morning again but it passed, fingers crossed the worse might be over,seeing Drs  tomorrow said hes felt\\nGillian, Thank your for posting your success story, it made me feel a lot better reading your post and all the comments.

Then tried 3 other meds but none worked so now I'm trying celexa again.\\n\\nYou're right, I think I will wait a bit longer. I got a new GP and I don't think she really knows what she's doing. When she prescribed it she told me to start with 10mg and increase 10mg each week until I start feeling better or get to 40mg. Which I know is way too fast because I have gone through this before.

I don't understand why it hasn't happened yet, I've had so much rejection. But I think I give off the wrong vibes. I don't know how to change it. I feel quite tearful at the moment. I'm at work but I'll probably go home and cry.\\n\\nHi Nicola Sorry to butt in on your conversation with everyone, but wanted to say that my son had a breakdown just over 2 years ago because he's not good at socialising and had a bad relationship which made him ill.  He started meds too, was very ill and couldn't work for 4 months - his doctor said to step outside his comfort zone a little.  I got him interested in music (African drumming and guitar ... not together mind  ) and slowly he felt able to go to the groups alone.  He also joined badminton and slowly he began to heal.  It took him 9 months to recover and is now back to normal.  Going out to social groups he met a lovely girl and they're still together and he still continues to play music.  He'll never be a social butterfly, as still struggles in some company, but he's going out and next week they're off to Italy for a holiday. Joining something will find friends first ...... and who knows what will follow.  I worked with my husband for 2 years before we got together ..... again we were friends first.  Sometimes that special person is right under your nose and you don't realise it\\nI have tried things like that but nothing yet. I just feel so low and crying again, I can't see any hope or point. I'm seeing the dr on friday again but i'm scared she'll up my dose and the hunger problems I had before will come back.\\nYou're not in the right place at the moment.  You need to look after yourself first ..... joining some groups (maybe something completely different to what you'd ever think of doing) should be for yourself first.  This will help you to heal too.  The meds will kick in and you'll feel in a much better place.  That person will come along some day. Many years ago when I was recovering I started dance classes.  What a way to build confidence!!  16 years later I'm now a dance teacher and I love watching how new students grow with confidence - all shapes and sizes (my best dancer is over 20 stone ...... such an amazing woman).  They do something for themselves and become absorbed in the music and movement.  I have one shy student in her 30's who's been internet dating, still looking 'for the one', but says dancing has made her feel different about herself  Recovery on these meds is slow - it often gets worse before it gets better, so I'm not surprised you'll feel at an all time low at the moment.  It really does get better. Your doctor can suggest you increase your dose, but at the end of the day its your body and completely your choice.  They can only advise.\\nThanks for Sharing how I'll your son was but most of all his success story that's great\\nHi Nicola Before I started Citalopram my confidence and self esteem had been shattered with being bullied by 2 girls where I worked I was in a right mess. I've been single for 3 years but once the meds got into my system everything else started to get better and I made still single but I know I will meet someone one day and so will you but like people have said you need to get yourself better first and it will all fall into place 🙂\\nI was better for ages and it didn't fall in to place. So I'm not that confident it will. I now you're trying to help but when it's never happened for you you can't imagine it ever will.\\n\\nUnfortunately after over 2 months I'm not feeling better and just don't want to get out of bed. Don't care about anything. Dr has changed my meds which I start in a few days. I'm quite scared to be honest.\\nHey Nicola,\\n\\n\\nOh Nicola, I am sorry.  When I restarted these meds it took much, much longer than the first time, and probably was about 7-8 months until they kicked in and I had a completely different experience 2nd time. I really hope the transition is as smooth as can be. Post back here when you're ready - everyone is here for you.\\nYeah I don't think I can do 7-8 months feeling like this.\\nAt the intensity you're feeling the symptoms, I don't blame you.\\nSorry to post on such a old post but would love your thoughts... I have taken citalopram 2 times before with amazing results after a rough initial month.  Came off it late last year honestly believing I didn't need to be on it. Anyway late Feb was struck back down, doctor told me to go back on them and said I can stay on them this time. I started on 20mg and had a rough couple of weeks, then started to feel much better, even remember thinking wow they've never worked this quickly before, then stupidly I upped the dose to 40mg as I had been on that before, side effects came crashing back, but then after 2 weeks again I began to feel better... until I saw a doctor who I asked for reassurance because even though I was feeling better I wanted reassurance it would work as well as it had done previously, she didn't give me that reassurance and told me that sometimes your hormones can change... since then I came crashing back down... 3 and a bit weeks ago I decided to give up on it and lowered my dose to 20mg to start weening but now I am in 2 minds whether to stick or move on. I want to stick as worked amazing in the past and don't want to put myself through the whole starting again with another drug... could it not be working as well this time simply because I have messed with the dose too much and not allowed it to settle? Or would you think it is simply not working this time? All in all I have been taking it 11 weeks, broken down as 2 on 20mg then 5 weeks and a couple of days on 40mg and now 4 weeks on 20mg... I think I am better than I was but everyday is still a struggle... not sure why it either isn't working or is taking longer to work this time?

My doctor advised that I take my tablet before bed so I wasn't as tired in the day but I have sleep problems so don't want to mess with that as I'm ok taking it in the morning.\\nHi everyone. im so glad I found this discussion. i have been on a therapeutic dose of 20mgs of Citalopram for the last 18 years after having the most horrendous P/N depression. I did come off them for a short time but ended up relapsing when my dad passed away. Anyway, I've just had quite a few major changes in my life and started with panic attacks, anxiety, insomnia, depression and no appetite at all. So I'm today on week 4 of 40mgs of Citalopram and still don't feel as though I'm there yet.  Im still struggling to eat, however I can sleep which is an improvement. The worst time for me is first thing in a morning. I struggle to get out of the bed and do feel quite nauseous and tired till late afternoon. As I'm writing this I feel 'okay'. I'm nowhere near as bad as I was with the P/N depression as back then I couldn't even look at my face in the mirror as it wasn't my face. Has anyone else experienced depersonalisation and the feeling that they aren't themselves. This for me is the worst bit of depression.\\nThanks Gilliam It does take a while doesn't it. So happy you're much better and thanks for the positive story\\nHi Everyone, I've been on and off of Celexa for years.  The first time I took it I was 21 and stayed on until I was 24 but gained about forty pounds.  I'm sure it wasn't just the medicine but it definitely increased my appetite.  I went on it again for a short period in 2006 to deal with some situational anxiety but once I switched jobs my doc pulled me off of it because she felt it was all job related.   So in 2012 I was going through a rough patch...had an occular  migraine , went through a long period of dating the wrong guys, and was dealing with the fear of losing my Grandmother who was very ill.  I started at 10 mg for a week and then moved to 20 mg.  It took about 3 to 4 weeks to start to feel better but a lot of my situations started to work themselves out (met a new boyfriend, figured out what my migraine was, etc.)    I dropped to 10 mg in 2014 because I was concerned about the  weight gain\\nAll the best!

It is too soon to consider a different ssri or to up the dose. Doc suggested at review at 12 weeks to see where things are at. I've gone this far so I can tough it out for 3 more weeks.

And your still on 20mg. Has your gp not suggested you increase to 40mgs? I found 20mgs didn't work for me, only 40mgs. Once I was totally better for over 6 months he then reduced it to 20mgs. Which I was on for years. I don't know if you remember me saying that my citalopram had stopped working so I've been out onto duloxetine. Well I did 2 weeks on 30mgs and as I was still anxious and low mood he increased it to 60mgs. I've done 19 days on the 60mgs and what a difference. No anxiety and sleeping and eating well. And my mood has greatly improved. I'm up and out and about now and going back to work in 2 weeks. I definatley think 40mgs would be better. Are you taking anything else to help with the anxiety? I had diazepam for a short while which helped x x you will get there. Are you managing to get out and about?\\nHi Angie, I work and have not taken any time off thru out this ordeal. However it has been difficult...actually pretty much hell. My doc did suggest an increase or even trying a different ssri but I am so afraid of starting all over with side effects with no guarantee that something new or an increase will make a difference. It is bearable but unpleasant now. I am just hoping that an improvement is coming soon. Interesting that for some they get relief at 8 weeks or so while for others it takes months. Unfortunately I fall in the later group😣 thanks for your note I appreciate any comments,  suggestions this forum has been a godsend on those horrible Days!  Shane\\nYes you have a positive attitude so you will get there but it's s long road but so worth it to feel better.its my first time on medication like this 2.\\nHi Shane, I'm in a similair situation to you.  I've been on 20 mg Citalopram for 6 mnths now and although things are so much better and I have spells when I feel back to my old self i'm not totally back to normal all the time and still feel very low at times.  I have been considering upping my dose to 30 mg but also scared about the side-effects coming back, even if if is for a couple of weeks, it's hard to deal with when you have to get on with your life.  I'm managing now so don't want to rock the boat.  Maybe if you have some time booked off work you could up to 30 mg, that's what i'm planning in the next few couple of weeks but whether I will or not I don't know. Have you been up and down or just down all the time? Also have you improved since before you starting taking them? It's hard having to wait so long for results but these things do take time and I think the worse you were before taking the medication and the longer you were ill the longer it takes to get better.\\n\\n\\nHi I'm sorry it was a typo. Only twice.  I want to give 15 a fair shot. Based on what I've read here and other articles although dose is important it seems giving time is vital. Until the brain decides to desensitize itself from extra serotonin levels free flowing and tells the neuron cells to go ahead fire away more we will continue to feel off.  I'm on week 4 on the med 10mg and 4th day on 15. Had a really good day yesterday hoping for more of those   Mornings are the absolute worst.  Thank you all for the encouragement\\nStarting my 5th week today. Experienced 4 consecutive days of feeling really good at the end of week 4 into the weekend where we are in vacation as a family.\\nHi. So I don't know whether to laugh at this or be scared. Today I arrived home from our 5 day vacation, on my drive home the  palpitations  started. As I got home much of the old  anxiety  thoughts and feelings I left behind slowly started to creep up. As I saw  my inlaws (who live with us and my father in law recently sick with  cancer  which triggered this anxiety spell 2 months ago)\\nYes I'm actually in low dose of metaprolol beta blocker. If I take too much it makes my anxiety worse.\\nIs it normal to be freakin out 5 weeks into medicine? I had 4 really good days as I said. Now I have a meeting for this morning and I couldn't sleep and I'm feeling super panicky this morning like I don't want to face the people at work.\\n\\nAlso does the clock start all over again each time you go up strength? In other words I'm 5 weeks total into the drug but only about a week and a half on the 15mg's.  Does it take another 4 to 6 weeks on the new strength? I though because I had a month built up of the 10mg and because I felt so good 2 days after going up to 15 that I would just get better faster. But now I'm wondering if it takes more time. The nurse did say I should be in another 4 weeks when they increased it.\\nYou don't get better faster because of dosage increase and yes you are likely to go through renewed side effects. My doctor has to me to do dosage increases slowly over a period of time so that they aren't as much of a shock to my system and the effects aren't as abrupt but yes I do still get them to some degree.\\nOh ok. I just need to give the 15 more weeks then. Even if I do end up on 20. I'm so sensitive to this stuff. Today has been really rough.  I hope there's truly light at end of tunnel that makes this sacrifice worth it. Sometimes I think of just quiting and trying to face it on my own again. But then I will feel good and think oh maybe there's hope for me yet.\\nI know and I appreciate your encouragement. But I'm feeling so bad right now on the 15. Side effects worse and lasting longer I just don't see how I can go to 20 now.\\nI feel like side effects are so much worse at the 15. I can't get any relief for the last 48 hrs. I didn't experience that on 10. I at least had good evenings or afternoons.  Anyone go to 15 and feel it was too much then went back to 10mg? How did that work out? I feel like 2 weeks into 15 this making me worse not better.  Any thoughts greatly appreciate.\\n\\n\\nHi Gillian It's great that you post motivational stuff and I love reading what you do to Stuart the day and far far you have come , it gives me hope ! 5th week on Cut 20mg , had a couple of good days , today not so much but still loads better than I was . Tomorrow morning I'm going to try and get up when I wake even if it's early as it has been and do things to keep my brain occupied and hopefully start the day better, I'm sure it will. Start the councilloring on Wednesday so hopefully that will help too,  anxiety  and stupid thoughts in my head are still exhausting but have been trying meditation and reading up on excepting the thoughts and then thinking of something else, it takes practice but I'm happy to keep trying. Still positive that I will get ME back soon and counting the weeks lol. Thanks again for your posts and support  Matt\\nHi Gillian I've just downloaded them and will give them a go. Thanks again  Matt\\nHi Gillian and all So at the moment I am getting myself ready to go food shopping, a shop with people in and decisions to make lol , feeling anxious and sweaty , so silly isn't it , it's just a shop !  Got up straight away this morning had a cup of tea then went for a walk , determined to stay out of my bed today , sick of the sight of it to be honest 😄 Just about 5 and a half weeks into 20mg of Cit , obviously better than I was o know I am but still struggling but know by reading all the posts on here that it will keep getting better just keep telling myself I've made progress. Keep posting positive things people , it helps so much. Matt\\nHi Gillian Thank you again , it's so reassuring to hear your posts. I went shopping with my husband, it wasn't to bad , when we got home I cried for about 20 minutes , maybe it was the tension ? I am at five and a half weeks now on 20mg and do know I am improving but do you think at this stage I should be back to normal? It's such a terrible thing anxiety, it's getting easier but still have a head full of nonsense and churning tummy , not as bad though , should all that be gone now at this stage ? Thanks again for your support and encouragement, I feel so needy it's a bit pathetic at my age , I'm 51 , it's like a want someone to tell me it'll be ok even though I know i am better than I was , silly really 😊  Matt\\nHello. Feeling much better on the Cit 10mg.  I'm curious anyone else get PVCs  palpitations\\nHello. Still feel better but noticed a few blips this weekend. Sat afternoon felt side effects from the medicine which I have not felt at all in days. And this Mon morning woke up feeling nervous and anxious thinking of all things I have to do feeling overwhelmed and some intrusive thoughts. Haven't felt any of that for a long time.  I do have a lot going at home with a bedroom remodel and busy at work but when I feel good none of that tends to matter. Is this normal? This starts my 3rd week on the 10 consistently after coming off 15. Total of 7 weeks on the med.  thanks.\\nBut what I feel today is the side effects from the drug. Not high anxiety which is what I'm taking it for, if I go up the side effects on got worse. I was great all week long. The only change was taking a different pill at 10mg feel side effects in the 2nd day so I went back to cutting the 20mg in half since I knew that pill worked for me and today on day 2 back on original i feel my worse. I guess I can't change at all once I'm in a groove. I know not all pills are the same. I'm hoping it doesn't take me too many days to feel back on track like I've been for a while.\\nThat's true. I guess since this all started back in June I feel as though I've been on this for 2 months already not 3 weeks. I wasn't thinking that after being on 15 for week I was starting all over again at 10. Dr did say be patient and give another 4 weeks but that it shouldn't take that long start feeling better. And really it hasn't. Felt great last week and good the week before. I guess I thought I was in the clear.\\nHibGillian and all I haven't posted for a few days as I wanted my post to be positive and it is! I am now in week 7 of 20mg and life has started to get good again 👍 As you all know the first few weeks are really tough , anxiety and Cit side effects , felt like giving up so many times and felt I would never make progress and life would be that scary and horrible forever but it does get better I am proof of it ! From not being able to get out of bed to enjoying walks, doing my hair putting make up on and going to the shops , it's truly amazing . Don't get me wrong mornings can still be a challenge but I get up straight away, do the dishes which I purposely leave from the night before so I have something to do , go for a 20 minute walk and the meditate using the Head Space app, my day get better earlier and earlier every day . All the horrid side effects have gone just tired and some blurry vision and sometimes mild headaches but apart from that all is good and improving all the time. I am going back to work next week , phased in to start with , I have been off 6 weeks , scared but positive that I need structure again and this will help. Keep going everyone it WILL get better , be kind to yourself and get outside and walk it really helps. Thanks to this amazing website I have had great support when I thought I was alone , it has really helped me and of course you Gillian , you have been a big part of my belief that I would get better so thank you so much. Still got a way to go I know that and I will have down days but at least I know know that I will get there. Matt\\nYeah. How long do these blips usually last? I felt better last night around 11pm and was able to go back to sleep. This morning as soon as eyes opened started feeling bad again. I haven't that feeling and over a week and a half. Now all of sudden it's back for like 3 days now. I feel like I'm going backwards.\\nFeeling horrid today. I miss How felt last week. Can't believe how I can have so many consecutive good days and then bam the bottom drops out 3 days\\nWent back on 10mg on July 9th so 2 and half weeks on 10mg's. With my second week last week being the best I've felt in months. And now this week feeling bad again.\\nThat's great to hear Matt! Awesome.\\nHi Gillian So been back to work all week on reduced hours , was all going well but have felt anxiety return from Thursday!! Had a couple of brain zaps during a stressful conversation with a colleague and started all the worry and knotted stomach again , what's going on I was feeling so good and positive, I'm terrified I'm going back the way 😩 Obviously no where near as bad as I was but gutted I am feeling like this at week 9 on 20mg. Any suggestions?  Thanks  Matt\\nHi Gill This colleague is a gossip and he just wouldn't get it. I know you have talked about blips so I'm hoping that's what this is , my councillor said it's likely due to starting back at work and feeling very proud and happy with myself the first couple of days and then dipping down and expecting to feel that high and sence of achievement all the time but I'm back to reality now! I'm just trying to push on and pray I don't go back the way , that would be horrible and I just can't let that happen. Thank you for your encouragement again , hope I get back on track very soon. Matt\\nHappy for your recovery. I can understand how worst you would have felt during that phase\\nHello good morning. I just wanted to share today marks the end of week 4 for me. I started back at work this past week and did pretty good. Felt some  anxiety  but not as bad as 2 months ago. I continue to have ups and downs. Week 3 was the worse for me. These last few days thought the high morning anxiety is back and it really doesn't ware off until the evenings. I'm trying to stay busy for example I took the family out to dinner yesterday and we went to the monster trucks show. I started to feel good around 8pm. I end up feeling good and energetic through midnight til I fall asleep but then wake up early around 7:30am with high anxiety and  palpitations . I'm a bit frustrated and worried because I though by end of week 4 I would feel more relief. Any words of encouragement greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah  take mine in the morning 8am too\\nHi Gillian I made to week 6 and like Magic a gradually got better that weekend. Had the best week in months even the morning anxiety went away it was awesome!!!\\nRough day continues. Just high anxiety and fear feeling. Haven't had in a couple of weeks.\\n\\n\\nHow’s things going with you? Hope your keeping well. Matt\\n\\nHi Lois  I’ve had a few ups and downs , had my meds changed, it’s been a bumpy couple of months but I can say I’m starting to feel like I’m getting there 👍 will be starting CBT soon . Matt\\nOh that's great ..so they change you to what?just curious.\\nThey put me from cit to 50mg Sertraline and I had to up it each week till I got to 200mg , also 15mg Mirtazapine. I had a seizure so the psychiatrist dropped to 100mg Sertraline, it was all to much for me along with the Diazipan. Three weeks ago I had my Mirena coil replaced, it had been in for 7.5 years so had run out of Progesterone, to be honest I’ve felt calmer since I had that coil , maybe a lot of my problems have been hormonal, who knows but I’m weaning off the Diazipan over the next month then want to get down to the theroptic dose of Sertraline which is 50mg and hopefully by the summer I can stop the Mirtazapine, will have to see how things go but I have a lot of faith in CBT . Glad your keeping well 😁 Matt\\nBless your heart..you been thru alot...wow that's alot of meds..but Happy your doing better...\\n\\n\\nI'm fed up, I've been taking Citalopram for 6 weeks now. 2 weeks 10mg, 4 weeks 20mg. Before taking Citalopram I started with sickness that woke me up at 5am most days and left me flat out in bed all morning (this all came in after a breakup.) Sometimes I would feel sick again later in the day. They treated me for a stomach ulcers, a month later I wasn't improving much and have got depressed and been off work exhausted. The doctors then diagnosed me with  depression\\n\\n\\nMy husband is taking Celexa and it took him seven weeks to feel positive again. He had been on it before also and it worked quicker the first time but the important thing is, it did work again. You will feel better but it may take time.  I found these forums a lifeline during the dark times. They gave me hope.  Are you seeing a therapist? It may help you lay the demons of the past to rest.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm no fan of going on bigger dose!I don't even like to take a Tylenol much less anything else.\\nIsn't 60milligrams no longer recommended . because of heart issues world wide?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you so much Gillian for the reply!I think my last experience with this after a miscarriage and bad reaction to an antibiotic afterwards left me in a severe state that took two years to come out of!I felt so sure I would not survive I had my wedding photographer take a pic of my family with me in it so they could remember me!I was put on Celexa forty mg and never looked back!I was completely me again 100 percent and stayed on that for five years and was doing great,weaned off during my last pregnancy and it slowly all came back while I was training for a half marathon and pouring coconut oil in my coffe.It was like my body crashed and I was doing everything I could to breathe and tried Celexa had a bad reaction stopped it after two days and then went five months w nothing till last November started on low low dose of Prozac 5 mg and worked up to forty!I wasn't helping much at all and my doc switched me straight to Celexa and this time my response was great and that was July and I did well with the switch,felt better all July and all August on the forty and then about nine weeks in started dipping for two straight weeks and my doc said my OCD needed a higher dose so she moved me to 60 mg which I have been on for two weeks!I cannot understand how I did so well those 4 to 6 weeks on the 40 and went backwards badly!I tried to wait it out but after two weeks I needed to do something!My sleep at night is good!I can no longer nap during the day like I used to do .I use to require naps because I have four kids and keep super busy being a mom and I run my own business doing hair,so I make my own hours.Is two weeks on higher dose too soon to tell?Does it start over again!I don't have bodily  anxiety\\nI’ll check it out , thanks for the heads up it may help me. Matt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHi everyone first time posting. Long story short I have had a very rough last 4 years. I started nursing school my kids dad passed away also lost several other loved ones that I havnt even had time to grieve for yet and I have 6 children. Needless to say I have an extremely stressful life. I've made it to last semester of nursing school and was hit with severe dabilitating  depression\\n\\nweek 7 just starting to feel better (been to hell and back)  one day at a time.\\nI was in 20mg for 2 years then it was upped to 40mg this year. It was it that stage I decided after a month to come off it because I felt great. Big mistake. 2 months later I decided to go back on the 40mg. Omg it was like my body was hit with every emotion going and my bladder was out of control which I was told it was a side effect etc. Any it’s was decided to reduce to 20mg. Before I knew it I’d taken an overdose and was taken to hospital. This was down to going on the 40mg straight away. I was check out by the hospital counsellors.  I’m now back home and it’s 3 weeks since going back on Cit and each day appears to be getting better although I’m still crying in the morning which is to be expected.\\n\\nHi Gillian  Update to say I’m in my 4th week back on Cit 20mg and I’m slowly starting to feel better, not perfect. The mornings are still the worst with crying etc. But the good feelings are longer and by night time I feel my old self.  Please; for others in the same or similar position stick with the it, it does improve 👍🏻 #loveyourself\\nHi Gillian  Update to say I’m in my 4th week back on Cit 20mg and I’m slowly starting to feel better, not perfect. The mornings are still the worst with crying etc. But the good feelings are longer and by night time I feel my old self.  Please; for others in the same or similar position stick with the it, it does improve 👍🏻 #loveyourself\\n\\n\\nI am about to go on 20mg citalopram which will be my 2nd time on the drug. I was on 10mg for 3 years and stopped taking them a little over a year ago not on purpose , I guess because I felt fine I just forgot to take them and I’ve been fine up until recently I can see old habits creeping back . Anyway I went to dr they prescribed them to me again.  I didn’t really get side effects the 1st time round apart from heightened anxiety for a month or so. I’m so worried this time that I will get lots of side effects and they won’t work as well as they did before. I mainly suffer with health anxiety and general anxiety which in turn causes  depression . So starting any medication makes me freak out. Please tell me there is light at the end of the tunnel and they will work for me like they did before\\nThank you for your reply. I definitely shouldn’t have come off it and I think I will need them forever . However at the moment I’m not sure if I will ever feel better again. Mornings and evenings are worst I think that’s because I am at work in the day so that occupies my mind.  I’m snappy when at home because I’m tired and fighting this anxiety that I don’t even know why it is there in the first place. I’m struggling with my appetite at the moment , I love food so the fact I can’t seem to finish my evening meal like I used to is bothering me , although I’m not sure if the heat has something to do with it\\nHi Gillian , How are you? I’ve missed some tablets again 😩 I’m re starting them today and will set an alarm to remind me to take them .  Back at square one again 😔\\nHi Gillian  thank you for all your sharing and everyone else on here  I started back on Celexa for 2nd time after 2 years off.   So this time I started in beginning of June this year , had to start low does do to being very sensitive to meds  so my first does was 10 MG for 10 days then 15 MG for 8 days after that 20 MG for 4 weeks hopping it would work for me again being that I was on that same does 2 years back . But after 4 week I got worse on it , so Gp put me up on 30 MG . I have been on this does now for 7 weeks tomorrow and still going though lots of side effects  , like  anxiety  attacKS very  high and for almost all day , hot chest , shaking ,  dry mouth  and so on . So today my husband seeing me like this thinks I need to go down a bit like 25 MG . He thinks the 30mg did what it supports to do but is to high for me now . Do u think its wise to do so , being that in the last few day it has given me very high strung anxiety and much more . I do have lorazapam 0.5 for anxiety attacks but they only help so long . Also first time today it woke me up @ 5 am what it never done before in the 7 weeks on the 30 MG . Please give me ur input or someone on here that has gone though something similar like me . Sorry for this long letter , but scared of not coming out on this Celexa this time when it helped me the first time 2 years ago . sorry forgot to inform you never been depressed in my life and anxiety was first then the  depression  came after being sick for over 1 year or longer because Dr could not find what was wrong with me . In that time being home losing wait and letting my job go   the anxiety came and not much longer the depression.  So I got this year sick again and in that time of being sick the anxiety came and also depression. I better stop this letter now , sorry for any miss spell and for it being soooo ò o long of a letter  looking forward to any replies  thank you  babsyboo\\nI totally agree with Gillian ! I think you're GP has given you poor advice and moved you up far too quickly through the doses.  Your body hasn't had time to adjust to one dose before moving up again - it doesn't know where it is. I was going through severe side effects  for 6 months , nausea, and horrendous insomnia.  Personally, I would try and get back to 20mg and stick it out - esp if it worked so well for you in the past.\\nHi Gillian 176 So on day 8 on 25mg and boy does my head hurt it feels like a headcold also still having side effects and anxiety attacks praying that this all will subside soon as I am waiting on coming out so happy to get all your reply thank you so much , sorry for any miss spell.

It was the Only med that relieved horrible, debilitating  depression .\\nare you still taking cit.?\\nHello everyone. Thank you Gillian, I'm happy to hear that you are feeling better with Citalopram. Depression is such a dreadful illness to suffer from, and it's really assuring and pleasing each time we hear that someone of us has won the fight.\\nHope0.0\\nHello babsyboo 😃 Thank you so much for your reply, actually yes no one has responded but you. Your reply is so comforting and assuring, thanks again 😃 It seems that we are not the only ones that are experiencing such side effects, I've been searching the Internet since nearly a month, and I came across this discussion thread via Drugs. Our mates there are adding a new word -tics- to our (tremor-and shaking terms) to describe the feeling. You'll find it assuring and comforting I'm sure 😃 Thanks again babsyboo, I wish you all the good health and recovery\\nthats helpful to me. thanks\\ntotally agreed gillian.\\ngillian agree 100%\\nhi gillian you have also given me comfort. made me feel better. thank you\\nGIllian you are so caring an comforting.I have struggled on and off for 30 years, mainly  intrusive thoughts and  anxiety .  I have always eventually done really well on  clomipramine  but it has been discontinued in UK. Started back on it last mid September then had to change to sertraline after Christmas because no longer available. After 2 weeks had to come off sertraline as caused horrendous rectal bleeding.Changed to mirtazapine, after 2weeks on this developedal pancreaticis and was nearly hospitalized.  I have now started citalopram, on day 4 at 20mg  your stories are so encouraging. I really hope these work.\\n\\nHow long have you been on at what was your dose before you upped to 40? Why did you increase?  I'm currently on 20 wondering if I need to up my dose is the reason that I ask.\\nI was on 20 for 4 years\\nHi the Celexa gives gas ☺ it's 1 off the many side effects that it gives hope u feel better soon it's good that u have Xanax it helps with the anxiety attacks that this pill give u babsyboo\\nHow would I know if I need to increase my dose?  Currently on 20.\\nHey  Gillian just up date a bit over 2 weeks on 5 MG Celexa and going off it tomorrow like u mentioned in ur last response back to me , thank u again hope u having fun on ur holiday and stay safe what u think  enough time to do so , get off after 2 weeks ?

       "      <td>I was in the E.R. yesterday for bad  palpitations  but and all of my tests came back good so they sent me home but I have been having this sensation of my body being filled with icy hot or hot water being poured all over and then going icy cold. My body is physically cold to the touch too but I feel hot on the inside if that makes any sense. I have been having this for a few days now and was wondering if it could be a withdrawl symptom from Citalopram, which I only took for like 4 days and have been off for about the same amount of time now. I have been diagnosed with  anxiety  for years now and have never experienced this symptom and it is quite scary and concerning. I am trying to breathe through it in hopes that it will subside but it seems to come and go at random and out of seemingly nowhere which always catches me off guard. I am currently not taking any other meds except for hydrochlorothiazide 25mg for high blood pressure which I have been taking quite some time and never experienced this symptom from. I feel like I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown because I have been having all my other anxiety symptoms for months now and that is why my doctor started the citalopram in the first place, which I stopped because it only intensified my symptoms. Anyone else experience this icy hot sensation???\\n\\nHi Rachel i had the same for about 10 days 8 weeks into taking 20mg citalopram a day. Awful feeling.... It could be because you started and stopped or it could be just another symptom of  anxiety . I hope you feel better soon</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've been om citalopram for three weeks now for  anxiety . First 10mg for a week and a half and then 20mg for a week and a half. After going to 20mg I started to feel better, not cured of course but calmer. Over the weekend I felt almost normal, more in control than before. But today I'm terrible again. I never suffered with panic attacks but today I've felt like a panic attack is just about to come on. I get almost intense waves of what I can only describe as fear. I'm also on my monthly cycle at the moment. Does this sound like side effects, even after starting to improve? I'm trying very hard to be patient as I know recover is slow... Thanks as always for all the support\\nIve been on Cit for almost seven weeks.  Four days on 10mg, five weeks on 20mg, and just upped to 30mg five days ago.  I did what you did.  I improved greatly on the 20mg, feeling almost back to myself, then the day I started my cycle, I crashed.  All of my  anxiety\\nhang on you are having a blip on top of your monthly.best regards\\nThis was my first cycle since being on the meds. Well, I had a cycle as I started the meds so didnt pay attention as I was feeling awful from the side effects.  Most people seem to have blips right before their cycle. If mine was related, it didnt happen until the day the period actually started. I did have someone respond to me in another thread that said she gets blips for 3-4 days before her cycle, so I'd say hormones arent helping us.\\nLois, I wish I had found this forum before upping my dose to 30mg. I think I would have given 20 more time to work.  Now that Ive upped to 30, do you have an opinion on staying with it or going back down?  Ive been on it for five days.  I fear going back and forth may cause even more probelms  Thoughts?\\n\\nLois, How long were you on the 20 before you went back to 10?  Did you have to deal with side  effects all over again when you went back down?\\nHi Marketta\\nIt may be worth asking Doctor for some 10 mg propranolol (beta blocker) which do help dampen the panic feelings a bit as long as you dont have any medical problems that prevent taking this.  Doctors seem quite happy prescribing this instead of diazepam.\\nHi Marketta,i am not surprised you are getting side effects as you are not  giving  1 dose enough time to work.You need to be on 1 dose for 8/10 weeks for the medication to work in your system  before changing your dosage.\\ni was on 20 for one week .but my severe  headache\\n\\n\\n\\nSo how many days have you been on the 20mg only?\\nIve been keeping a journal and it looks like I stopped having the morning  anxiety\\n\\nMaybe we can touch base in a week and we'll both be feeling some improvement!\\nFeel free to private message me.  Weve got this!\\n\\n\\nim just finishing my monthly and wondered if it was related, bc this happened last month, but it seems worse today, and this is the last day of the monthly.  im sorry youre still feeling bad, too!  im really starting to question being on them.\\nabsolutely .\\nive been keeping a journal from day one.  it has been veey helpful!\\n\\nHey marketta! Hope you feeling better. I started celexa 20 mg since Feb 13 . Its been about 10 weeks. I have been feeling anxiety and get side effects still. I still have panicky feelings daily  with bad muscular tension. I went to a store today and felt very anxious and have some as i type this. Mornings are tough too to get going with all this. I have been getting down about this lately as well . My doc wants to up the dose to 30 mg but im torn on that as people say not to do it.\\nIm five weeks in on the upped dose of 30mg.  Im still not sure increasing was a wise choice, but am going to try and stick with it for 12 weeks and reassess.  What helps me when Im having the bad\\nHello Lois! I am going down on 20 mg celexa to 10 mg  and thinking of going off it. I been on 10 for a few days and feel unwell still.  I get intrusive thoughts as well. I was on celexa 20 mg for  a lmost 13 weeks with side effects from a to z  which i couldnt function on. I also get muscle pain and jaw pain with this med. I  am having a hard time doing things daily. I lay around a lot which i hate. I try to get out from time to time but struggle. My therapist thinks im getting worse  depression\\nperhaps if your doctor prescribe a benzo it would be much easier for you to cope with the side effects.\\nHey Lois! Arent benzos tough to take everyday? They are hard to come off of and addictive properties. I struggle everyday to function from mornings are terrible until evenings . I guess i need something to function.\\n\\n\\nHey Lois i went down to 10 mg from 20 mg.  Im kinda getting tired of this med and feeling this way. I am thinking of  getting off this stuff . Is that a decent dose? How did you know celexa started working when on benzos? The doc also mentioned something about cymbalta. Thanks!\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I've just been to my gp for a check up after being on my citalopram 40mg for 5 weeks now. I told her that my side effects are starting to go now and that even though I've had a little bit of improvement, (chatting a bit more, less anxious, still feel low but not crying as much) I still feel like their is a lot of room for improvement. She told me that after 4-6 weeks I should notice a difference and said this was a good sign that my tablets are working and they should have reached a peak by now. What I'm confused about is, is this it then? I asked her if I would keep improving and I didn't really get a straight answer so I don't know if things will keep getting better as time goes on and will I still start to feel better because I feel like I'm no where near what I was like before. She didn't offer a change just told me I will need to take them for atleast 6 months-1 year. So will i keep improving for a bit because I really don't feel like I'm half way their yet.\\npointless asking a doctor they know nothing about  antidepressants\\nyes, well too early to tell! these are powerful drugs, put it this way i reduced from 10mg to 6mg 11 months ago and only just starting to have better days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntotally understand.may i ask what made you stay on them for so long if you werent really getting benefits from them?\\nhave you ever heard of polydrugging? its what doctors are good at, basically the first drug i got put on caused a symptom the docs think its real so give you another on top which causes another symptom until the patient doesnt know what is causing what, it never stops unless you end up being rushed to hospital with a suspected  stroke\\nyes i totally understand that polydrugging after my  doctor try to misdiagnose me for having  arthritis .and trying to give me drugs for it .thank god i was aware of all the side effects n meds interactions.other wise i would of probably had all kinds of poop going on in my system.when i told my doctor that she was wrong she couldnt believe that i said no to her arthritis meds.\\n\\ni bet .after all these decades that the ssris have been on the market you think they would know something.other than oh yoh will be find in two weeks.i guess they dont want to verbally scare their patients.with med drama.\\n\\ntook me eight months .i know everyones chemistry is different .and iam still improving after been on them for roughly 3years.\\nmost definitely.\\nboth.\\n\\noh my goodness it was and is the best feeling ever.\\nyes for 8full months.\\n\\n\\ncompletely gone.that is why i would never come off .cant risk that ant feeling terrorizing me again.\\nI've been on citalopram a total of 7 months now, I was initially on 10mg, they increased me to 20mg and I stayed on that for 5.5 months. I found that the 20mg seemed much to high for me, it made me numb emotionally, and just felt weird so I reduced to 15mg, and  so far and the past week I feel much more like my old self. So it's really a guessing game as to the right dose, and how long it takes to feel 'much' better. You will have periods of feeling better, and then a dip, then feeling better, to where the dips happen rarely and the majority of time you feel good. Don't get discouraged if you have a dip just bare through it and tell yourself its temp and you're still on the path to feeling better! My doctor also told me 6-8 weeks for full effect, that is so far from true for most people, most of the time. I would say you should 'start' having some good days by then, and they will continue to increase for months, some people have said up to 7-8 months. So just give it time, stick with it. Best Wishes!\\n\\ni totally understand the adrenaline drama. i had that for 8months . it would start in my stomach and it would end on top of my head the most bizzare feeling in the world.\\n\\n\\nyes despair is definitely the correct definition.like omg what is happening why do i feel like this.etc.\\nAh, the good old doctors advice again ……. It may be that the meds reach their peak by 4-6 weeks (I’m not a medic so have no idea) but that doesn’t mean you will feel well by 4-6 weeks. These meds like all SSRI’s are slow working - it took me 6 months to feel better.  No this is not your maximum - you have a long way to go yet.  4-6 weeks is really early. Even though you may feel some improvement already, don’t be fooled, because usually recovery comes and goes - and that means the symptoms come back time after time (setbacks / blips).  This is completely normal and is just the way the meds work. So yes - you will keep improving, but as said, don’t be too surprised if you start feeling ill again.  Its perfectly normal.  Just keep going and those setbacks will finally cease to come. Don’t be in a rush either - let recovery come and go and you’ll find over time you’ll feel better and better.\\nMwahahahahaha …… 😅 😅 me, celeb?  Just an ordinary pleb lol. Anxiety is a strange condition to have and its just as strange when recovering, as it foxes people into thinking they’re not getting better.  But the meds are working despite how bad you might feel. Glad you’re feeling some relief and yes, it should improve much more over time. Let us know how it goes. ps ……. shall I send you my autograph hahaha 🤣\\n📖 🖍 .... there you go 🤣 I've just seen people go through what I did many moons ago ... thinking the same, going down the wrong path, feeling the same feelings ..... so just like to lend a hand and pass on what I learnt as I recovered. Yes the anxiety will come and go, and seems for no reason.  Its actually your reaction to it that counts - freak about it, try and run away, try and stop it and it'll just cling all the more - but letting it be, work with it, take it with you (however bad it feels), acknowledge it and don't start analysing it then it will lose its power and ease off.  Its not easy, but thats the way forward. Also don't overdo things - when you've got anxiety it means your body has reached its overload with stress and your body is tired, so as you recover take things easy, slow yourself down and be gentle on yourself. Yes your mindset will change a lot - when you're having good times your body will feel calm and your thoughts light and lifting - then when anxiety hits you it seems all you've felt yesterday has gone out the window today as you feel frightened, think negative thoughts and can't see a way forward. Its just anxiety that brings these effects with it - so an anxious body = an anxious mind and a calm body = a calm mind. One more thing - don't hope tomorrow is a good day, because if it isn't then you'll feel even more disappointed and frustrated.  Instead accept whatever comes and just know that the anxiety will pass ..... maybe tomorrow, maybe next week or the week after.  Let it come and go as it pleases.\\nAnxiety is always worse in the mornings - apparently its to do with Cortisol being at its highest first thing when waking. Bad mornings and calmer evenings is exactly how recovery worked for me - by the evening I’d feel a little calmer, and over time I began to look forward to my evenings as they got better.  Those good feelings gradually crept into more into my day so I’d start feeling more at ease earlier and earlier - and around 6 months I finally started waking with no anxiety.  Throughout that time I still had blips where I felt rubbish all day, but those days passed. Yes it is tiring - its always 3 steps forward and 2 steps back … all the way. You will get better - just let recovery come to you - it will.\\nHi Potatoghost Just been reading your initial post and was wondering whether your doctor started you on 40mg or whether you have increased to 40mg. It seems such a high dose if that's what you've started on. In either case it may be worth discussing with your doctor whether a dose adjustment may suit you better.\\nhave you asked the doctor for a short term benzo??\\ni call it impending doom, at one point i was terrified of everything, scared to snap a bar of dark chocolate (seriously) ive been like that many months, it does ease\\nHi\\nhigh blood pressure meds are good for folks who have speaking to an audience anxiety or who have heart  palpitations .but too add a high blood pressure med to mental issues is Ludicrous .how ling where you on mirt.?\\n\\ntotally agreed with you .\\nhonestly i can still only watch certain things as some trigger me, how long were you on mirtazapine for?\\nyes i agree, ive come off mirt 3 times the first 2 were easy the last time was hell it lasted only 4 months, also from what ive read on here some peoples cit withdrawal sound less severe than others ive read elsewhere i literally have 100s of symptoms, just shows how everyone is different\\nyou have to remember every time you fiddle with the dose is like starting the process all over again for most folks.\\n\\n\\ndo not be afraid to take your benzo your doctor prescribe.why suffer?\\nive been in withdrawal in one form or another fir nearly 2 years, adding meds and changing doses will mess with your CNS so be careful\\ni know for a fact the benzo will not make you depress .i would be more worry about changing meds or increasing meds.\\nHi Potatoghost\\ni have a mirtazapine withdrawal support group on facebook\\n\\nbingo\\ni tell you one thing without that benzo i would of ended in a mental institution.at first they wouldnt give it to me  after five months of suffering they finally approve my benzo. only use it for one year .the lowest dose .i just stop taking it  one day no withdrawl no drama for me .\\n\\nnot anymore docs here in the uk rarely give them out as theyre so addictive even short term, i have 42 untouched diazepam i wont take them as took them for 5 days and had terrible withdrawals for months also they make you feel down when theyre wearing off, of course everyone is different but personally its a no from me! also cns is your central nervous system\\nwell i be dammed.then you should already know the benzo does not give  depression .bite the bullet and dont suffer.\\nthank goodness i dont have an addictive personality.i cant even drink a glass of wine .lol\\nif i drink i want to sleep.lol</td>\n",

       "0  can anyone tell me how much Citalopram can affect weight? I increased my dose from 20mg to 40mg back in early Jan and had some  weight gain . GP reduced dosage to 30 mg as she wasn't happy with me on the high dose for long periods. My  depression  has improved and I'm about to return to work. I maintain a healthy diet (low carb) and have massively increased my exercise to help with both fitness and low mood. However, despite all this the weight has hardly changed at all. Is Citalopram having an effect?\\n\\ni am currently on 10mg and i have found myself gaining weight since being on the tablets. i found myself craving carbs at one point but that seems to have stopped.  i have also increased my excersise to try and minimise the  weight gain .\\nabsolutely, iv been on them for about 3 years, i find it hard to loose weight but it is coming off slowly, when this med works to full effect its funny how it loves the calories, good luck

       "1  I just wanted to feed back to you all how wonderful I am feeling week12 on citalopram 20 mg This is my second time on this drug since 2013. With hindsight I should never really have come off it but stayed at a very low dose . I spent hours..again ...researching the internet in the early stages. This time it took 6 weeks until I started to feel better. It had taken only 2 the first time Yes I had all the side effects and felt much much worse whilst my brain waited to rewire  itself in those initial weeks It may not be the drug for everyone but it's worked wonders for me  So I just wanted to comfort and give empathy to those of you out there who are still on their journey My path is now much straighter Good luck all \\n\\nHi Gillian I read your posts which really encourages me so thank you. I have been on 20mg of Cit for three weeks now, was on 10 for a year after dropping from 20 as I felt I could , silly mistake! I came crashing down 3 weeks ago after starting a new job, anxiety in the mornings is driving me insane and then really flat all day , can't wait to sleep but get anxious about waking up knowing the anxiety will be there! Any idea how much longer it will take for the Cit to stop the anxiety? I just want to be me again , get out of the house and get on with my life ! Thank you\\nHi Gillian I am not nearly at 5 weeks on 20mg Cit (Saturday is 5 weeks not that I'm counting!) side effects just about gone now and I have been out walking the last 4 days , hadn't left my bed for 3 weeks before that , morning anxiety is still a big issue very unpleasant but generally lifts by the afternoon and evening in fact I have felt pretty good the last couple of evenings. Still waking up very early and can't get back to sleep but I'm sure that will improve too. Will need a couple more weeks off work and hope they hold my job for me , it's a new job so still in probation period. Keep telling myself I will get back to ME but it's hard to see it ! Defo making progress and have an appointment today with a councillor for an assessment, that's making me anxious 😩. But all in all I am getting better and sticking with Cit was the right thing to do. Thanks for your encouragement it really helps me.\\n\\nHi, I realise this is an old post but I was wondering how things are now? Better? I am on week 4 and although I am considerably better in relation to the start of this all .... I have the same issue with morning anxiety and throughout the day. For no apparent reason, which is so much more frustrating. I’m not giving up hope but I still struggle with the feeling of “is this ever going to stop”  ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\\n\\nHey rachel77333,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the sleeping algorithms I’m not sure I think that was someone else.

Just got down from 20 MG after being  on it for 5 month with high  anxiety  and bad side effects.  So we decided to go down to 10 MG . My side effects got less but still have anxiety and crying spells is that normal ?  I still get headaches,  nausea,  shakes and so on . They come in the morning really strong then lessened though the day . So I got on this medicine put on because I was sick , with being sick came anxiety and  depression\\nThanks for your success story in the same and yes I felt my best after 3 months and are now 4 months down the line and feel back to normal and still in 15mg\\nI'm so pleased to hear that you're feeling so much better gillian .  It took me from August to January to feel good again and finally got back to work.  Still can't believe what a nightmare it's all been !\\nHi Gerrymoo, i'm just coming up to 3 months on 20 mg Citalopram and still feeling pretty bad.  When did you start to feel better and in what way? Would very much appreciate your feedback as I'm worried these are not this is not the right medicine for me.\\nHi Anna, briefly with no past history I was hit with a sudden wall of  anxiety  last summer , cutting a very long story short I started 10mg citalopram which was increased to 20mg 3 wks later.  I had terrible side effects both on   10mg and then increasing to 20mg.  Increased anxiety made me think I was going out of my mind. Combined with nausea and insomnia made life pretty miserable. I just felt exhausted and lost about two and half stone . Gradually from going through every awful day to having better spells towards evening, life started improving.  I felt a notice improvement towards Christmas and a definite improvement mid January.   Strangely enough the sudden improvement followed a blip in which I was advised to go up to 30mg.  I didn't, I prayed it was a blip.and it was.  Valium and the support from this forum got me through such a terrible time! .. I'm back at work fully now and coping in a very busy stressful environment, hang on in there Anna.  Are you having some good days or parts of a day?  If so then it's obviously starting to work .  It's so hard\\nThanks so much for getting back to me.  It gives me hope that it took a while for you to recover.  I have had good days but not recently (last 2 weeks have been tough) but yes, I usually feel better in the evenings and a couple of weekends ago I thought I was ok again. Glad to hear you're back at work and you've put this ordeal behind you. Hopefully this is just a blip I'm having before an improvement.\\nHi gerrymoo  How long were young off work for?

Things are sorted now.\\nHi Zoe, I was off for 5 months in total- a long time!  It's a strange  one  really because I love my job añd although it's very demanding both physically and mentally I never believed it was the cause of my anxiety.  However, I had been pretty well over Christmas and then had a horrible blip 1st week in january and had an appt with my GP who signed me off another month and told me to increase the dose to 30mg.\\nI've been off 10weeks.  If having a phased return too.  I just don't like the thought of returning and not being 100%. I know that being off work now is not helping my recovery and that I will feel better once in there.  I thank me confidence has just had a knock.\\n\\nAs it said previously I know my anxiety is going to ramping ⤴ with the thought of going back to work. Hey-ho it is!! I really want to go back and know that by working I well have less time to ruminate.  I have put everything in place to make the first day as stress free as I can but it just so nervous.  Any advice to prepare please?\\nHow are you feeling now?  Just wondering, since it has been a little over a month since your last post.  I was upped dosages pretty quickly on this medicine and going to talk to my GP today.  I went from 10 to 20 to 40 within three weeks.  So it has been a lot of fun with the side effects\\n\\nHow long before you started feeling better?\\n\\nThat's good to hear.

Mind over Mood and The 5 Second Rule.  Basically we cannot allow our feelings, our emotions dictate our actions. We may not feel like getting out of bed, we may not feel like going for a walk or eating healthy but we need count down in our heads 5,4,3,2,1 and when we hit 1 get up and do what we need to do. It's hard. You won't like it at first but overtime it works. You retrain your brain by your actions. You can't think your way out of anxiety. You have to take action. Fake it till you become it.\\n\\nHI just wondering how you getting g on, I am haveing negativethoughts too, only on 10mg\\nIt is good to hear positive stuff.

Sorry its a long post. When starting an SSRI or increasing it's dose often makes people feel really rubbish, which can cause a great deal of stress as you begin to wonder whats happening, why is their illness getting worse, are these meds working etc. Somone recently posted a great post explaining what these meds do in our brains, and I’d like to add further to this.  So, as already posted ….. the brain is basically a big dense bundle of nerves which carry electrical signals around our brain and body.  The nerve cells don’t touch each other, leaving a small gap between each cell, called a synapse.  So how do signals get from one nerve to another? Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by nerve cells that tell a neighbouring nerve cell to pass the signal along.  A bit like pass the parcel.  Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter.   So when an electrical signal reaches the end of a nerve cell that deals with serotonin, that cell releases serotonin into the gap (synapse), which then crosses the gap and interacts with the nearby nerve cell and tells it to pass the signal along. Once the serotonin has done it's job, the serotonin is then reabsorbed from the gap so that no more signals are passed until the next one comes down the nerve.  SSRIs, (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) interfere with this reabsorbtion process and thus it stays in the gap longer, which equates to more serotonin and more signals. So furthering on from there ….. why do you feel so rubbish? So, along with the releasing of serotonin, and reabsorbing it, nerve cells also have parts that detect an increase in serotonin level and tell the nerve cell to stop producing anymore serotonin until the level drops.  These are called autoreceptors, which are the reason you feel like so rubbish. So the SSRI will increase the amount of serotonin that’s gathered in the synapses between nerve cells, but unfortunately the autoreceptors of the nerve cell pick up on this increase and tell the nerve cell to stop producing serotonin.  The result of this is that when you first start taking an SSRI your serotonin levels drop. How do they go up again? Eventually with continuous use of the SSRI medication, the autoreceptors become desensitised, that is to say they've continually told the nerve cell to stop producing serotonin but yet serotonin is still there.  In short they simply give up.  They stop telling the nerve cell to stop producing serotonin and your serotonin levels start to increase. This desensitisation takes time, it doesn't happen over night and it won't even begin to happen until the SSRI levels have stabilised.  This is why you feel so rubbish, and is why your mood drops and your anxiety increases (also fuelledd by the fear of not knowing whats going on).  Your mood will be up and down as the seronotin continues to try to stablise. So, to summarise: SSRIs cause your serotonin levels to drop when you first start taking them.  Your serotonin levels will not rise until the autoreceptors in your brain have stopped working (become desensitised), all of which takes lots and lots of time.  Everyone is different, so for some it can be many weeks and other months. I hope this helps some people to understand what these meds are doing and why you don't get instant results, compared to other meds that work in different ways which is the reason they can have a more immediate effects (benzos for example).\\n\\nHow are you now?\\nIt could be weeks or months till he feels better,he frightened he want be ever be able to go back to work Hes only been on them 4 days , l feel sorry for him hes such a strong man\\nHi merry Christmas.

Hope you see this as I am afraid to go back on after being off for 8 months.

Want to reinstate but have read it can make it all worse. Your story makes me feel better about going back on them. Just wondering about your reinstatement dose and how long between not taking and reinstating. Thanks so much.\\nHi there! Well I was only off them very briefly in 2000. Then went straight back on the 20mgs. So I've been on 20mgs for 17 years and they have kept me going. So 4 weeks ago I had to have hem upped to 40mgs due to moving house, job etc and it kicked everything off. Not been like this for 17 years!!  I'm still quite anxious and getting up in the morning is a struggle..  But hopefully the next couple of weeks they will start to work. I hate this feeling so much as I feel like it's such an effort to just get through the day.

Your husband really needs to take the citalopram at the same time every day.  It's really important to keep the levels steady in his system rather than taking it erratically.  Had he got some diazepam to help with the  anxiety /panics.  It was a life saver for me. Gerry\\nHi Merry Christmas. I'm sorry to hear he's having such a rough time, It takes somebody to be very brave to admit that they are having suicidal thoughts but I can't stress the importance enough of taking your citalopram at the same time everyday. You need to be really strict with this, He's only making it harder for himself. What you should both focus on is that infact he had a good day on saturday, and try not to get disheartened that It only lasted a small amount of time, those days will get easier. By Day 7 I was ready to throw in the towel, but now I'm on Day 16 and extremely glad I didn't. Your husband needs to talk to somebody regarding the thought's hes having to ensure he understands what is happening. I doubt that your husband is actually suicidal, I certainly know I had suicidal thoughts during the worst part of citalopram but when your at that level of anxious its very easy to confuse the fear of becoming suicidal/not being able to cope with that of being suicidal. This will get better, I'm looking forward to hearing about his recovery in the coming weeks. I understand that as a man, my natural reaction is to \"help myself get better\". I'm absolutely work motivated and terrible when I'm off for anything, being Anxiety only makes that worse due to the nature of the illness. I want your husband to know that I've been through what he is experiencing, He might not believe me but what he is experiencing is most definetly temporary, and you can 100% blame the Citalopram for it because It's scientifically proven that these drugs make you feel worse before they make you feel better. Can I suggest that you look into a book called \"DARE\", Its available on Amazon Prime and I found it really helped me understand and cope with the first few weeks, and It's also extremely therapeutic to read about the techniques you can use to help yourself recover.  Your husband most likely will be struggling to \"keep busy\" at the moment, so the bad days probably feel like they are going to last forever. I think its really important that you continue to do gentle activities when in your worst state, This won't be easy but I utilised the mentalityy \"Well I feel so bad so this really can't make me feel any worse so why the hell not\". Gentle walks, watching a funny TV show, visiting close family and friends who can offer support, Drawing.  Please take the tablet at the same time everyday, I don't sleep well with them at the start so I take them in the morning with Breakfast. Have a look at MIND mental health charity to see if they can support your husband in the early days of this medication. Progress is going to be slow, and there is going to be setbacks but he needs to keep reminding himself that this is a Temporary Problem caused by his body's inability to calibrate to the drugs any quicker. When I felt awful last week, I told myself this statement probably over 500 times a day just to put things into perspective.

Then tried 3 other meds but none worked so now I'm trying celexa again.\\n\\nYou're right, I think I will wait a bit longer. I got a new GP and I don't think she really knows what she's doing. When she prescribed it she told me to start with 10mg and increase 10mg each week until I start feeling better or get to 40mg. Which I know is way too fast because I have gone through this before.

I don't understand why it hasn't happened yet, I've had so much rejection. But I think I give off the wrong vibes. I don't know how to change it. I feel quite tearful at the moment. I'm at work but I'll probably go home and cry.\\n\\nHi Nicola Sorry to butt in on your conversation with everyone, but wanted to say that my son had a breakdown just over 2 years ago because he's not good at socialising and had a bad relationship which made him ill.  He started meds too, was very ill and couldn't work for 4 months - his doctor said to step outside his comfort zone a little.  I got him interested in music (African drumming and guitar ... not together mind  ) and slowly he felt able to go to the groups alone.  He also joined badminton and slowly he began to heal.  It took him 9 months to recover and is now back to normal.  Going out to social groups he met a lovely girl and they're still together and he still continues to play music.  He'll never be a social butterfly, as still struggles in some company, but he's going out and next week they're off to Italy for a holiday. Joining something will find friends first ...... and who knows what will follow.  I worked with my husband for 2 years before we got together ..... again we were friends first.  Sometimes that special person is right under your nose and you don't realise it\\nI have tried things like that but nothing yet. I just feel so low and crying again, I can't see any hope or point. I'm seeing the dr on friday again but i'm scared she'll up my dose and the hunger problems I had before will come back.\\nYou're not in the right place at the moment.  You need to look after yourself first ..... joining some groups (maybe something completely different to what you'd ever think of doing) should be for yourself first.  This will help you to heal too.  The meds will kick in and you'll feel in a much better place.  That person will come along some day. Many years ago when I was recovering I started dance classes.  What a way to build confidence!!  16 years later I'm now a dance teacher and I love watching how new students grow with confidence - all shapes and sizes (my best dancer is over 20 stone ...... such an amazing woman).  They do something for themselves and become absorbed in the music and movement.  I have one shy student in her 30's who's been internet dating, still looking 'for the one', but says dancing has made her feel different about herself  Recovery on these meds is slow - it often gets worse before it gets better, so I'm not surprised you'll feel at an all time low at the moment.  It really does get better. Your doctor can suggest you increase your dose, but at the end of the day its your body and completely your choice.  They can only advise.\\nThanks for Sharing how I'll your son was but most of all his success story that's great\\nHi Nicola Before I started Citalopram my confidence and self esteem had been shattered with being bullied by 2 girls where I worked I was in a right mess. I've been single for 3 years but once the meds got into my system everything else started to get better and I made still single but I know I will meet someone one day and so will you but like people have said you need to get yourself better first and it will all fall into place 🙂\\nI was better for ages and it didn't fall in to place. So I'm not that confident it will. I now you're trying to help but when it's never happened for you you can't imagine it ever will.\\n\\nUnfortunately after over 2 months I'm not feeling better and just don't want to get out of bed.

I have taken citalopram 2 times before with amazing results after a rough initial month.  Came off it late last year honestly believing I didn't need to be on it. Anyway late Feb was struck back down, doctor told me to go back on them and said I can stay on them this time. I started on 20mg and had a rough couple of weeks, then started to feel much better, even remember thinking wow they've never worked this quickly before, then stupidly I upped the dose to 40mg as I had been on that before, side effects came crashing back, but then after 2 weeks again I began to feel better... until I saw a doctor who I asked for reassurance because even though I was feeling better I wanted reassurance it would work as well as it had done previously, she didn't give me that reassurance and told me that sometimes your hormones can change... since then I came crashing back down... 3 and a bit weeks ago I decided to give up on it and lowered my dose to 20mg to start weening but now I am in 2 minds whether to stick or move on. I want to stick as worked amazing in the past and don't want to put myself through the whole starting again with another drug... could it not be working as well this time simply because I have messed with the dose too much and not allowed it to settle? Or would you think it is simply not working this time? All in all I have been taking it 11 weeks, broken down as 2 on 20mg then 5 weeks and a couple of days on 40mg and now 4 weeks on 20mg... I think I am better than I was but everyday is still a struggle... not sure why it either isn't working or is taking longer to work this time?

I did come off them for a short time but ended up relapsing when my dad passed away. Anyway, I've just had quite a few major changes in my life and started with panic attacks, anxiety, insomnia, depression and no appetite at all. So I'm today on week 4 of 40mgs of Citalopram and still don't feel as though I'm there yet.  Im still struggling to eat, however I can sleep which is an improvement. The worst time for me is first thing in a morning. I struggle to get out of the bed and do feel quite nauseous and tired till late afternoon. As I'm writing this I feel 'okay'. I'm nowhere near as bad as I was with the P/N depression as back then I couldn't even look at my face in the mirror as it wasn't my face. Has anyone else experienced depersonalisation and the feeling that they aren't themselves. This for me is the worst bit of depression.\\nThanks Gilliam It does take a while doesn't it. So happy you're much better and thanks for the positive story\\nHi Everyone, I've been on and off of Celexa for years.  The first time I took it I was 21 and stayed on until I was 24 but gained about forty pounds.  I'm sure it wasn't just the medicine but it definitely increased my appetite.  I went on it again for a short period in 2006 to deal with some situational anxiety but once I switched jobs my doc pulled me off of it because she felt it was all job related.   So in 2012 I was going through a rough patch...had an occular  migraine , went through a long period of dating the wrong guys, and was dealing with the fear of losing my Grandmother who was very ill.  I started at 10 mg for a week and then moved to 20 mg.  It took about 3 to 4 weeks to start to feel better but a lot of my situations started to work themselves out (met a new boyfriend, figured out what my migraine was, etc.)    I dropped to 10 mg in 2014 because I was concerned about the  weight gain\\nAll the best! Shane\\n\\n\\nHi Shane. I too am exactly the same as you. Just hanging on in there getting through each day. Friends keep asking, ' you got any plans for this week' I say, I'm just gonna try and get through it to which they say sorry. It's difficult for some to understand isn't it. I'm week 5 now. Although last time which was a long time ago was around the 8/9 week mark when I saw some 'good' days. So keep going Shane. We have to. It's the only way to beat it and come out the other side stronger than ever x x\\nYou are certainly correct we just need to keep on fighting thru the tough days to get to the better days ahead.\\nYes we do. We will get there! Just try and keep positive too and say nice things to yourself. Apparently it gets into the subconscious and helps with healing.  Keep in touch\\n\\n\\n\\nHi Shane\\nHi Sarah, not happy that you are having these side effects but glad that it is not only me...if that makes any Sense!  I saw my doctor today and she confirmed what Gillian and Katecogs often say. It gets better with time and just stay the course because gradually we will see improvements. It is too soon to consider a different ssri or to up the dose. Doc suggested at review at 12 weeks to see where things are at. I've gone this far so I can tough it out for 3 more weeks.  Bloody hard some days though! Hang In!  Shane\\nShane\\n\\n\\nHi Shane,  What do you think about this I have taken citalopram 2 times before with amazing results after a rough initial month.  Came off it late last year honestly believing I didn't need to be on it. Anyway late Feb was struck back down, doctor told me to go back on them and said I can stay on them this time. I started on 20mg and had a rough couple of weeks, then started to feel much better, even remember thinking wow they've never worked this quickly before, then stupidly I upped the dose to 40mg as I had been on that before, side effects came crashing back, but then after 2 weeks again I began to feel better... until I saw a doctor who I asked for reassurance because even though I was feeling better I wanted reassurance it would work as well as it had done previously, she didn't give me that reassurance and told me that sometimes your hormones can change... since then I came crashing back down... 3 and a bit weeks ago I decided to give up on it and lowered my dose to 20mg to start weening but now I am in 2 minds whether to stick or move on. I want to stick as worked amazing in the past and don't want to put myself through the whole starting again with another drug... could it not be working as well this time simply because I have messed with the dose too much and not allowed it to settle? Or would you think it is simply not working this time? All in all I have been taking it 11 weeks, broken down as 2 on 20mg then 5 weeks and a couple of days on 40mg and now 4 weeks on 20mg...   Good luck with your battle, people say we have to stay strong or be strong, I think unless you've been through this you don't even know what being strong is haha\\nHi Gillian, at what stage was you sure you was feeling better?\\nStay strong, you can get there. Shane\\nI am hoping 12 weeks will be a milestone for better days to kick in. Shane\\nHi Shane.\\nShane\\nHi Thank you for this post it gives me hope. I am on week 3 and the mornings are just horrible, can't wait to feel better. This positive post helps me no end Thanks !\\nHi Gillian I'm nearly at week 3 , feels so awful but reading these posts is keeping me going . Just want to feel free from this  anxiety  and  depression  but I know I will just got to wait and let the ctl take effect. Thanks\\nHi Gillian Thanks again. I'm new to this site so just getting used to finding any replies! Matt\\n\\nHi I've been on cit for 4 months and the first few weeks are the worst but I'm nearly back to my old self.tell him to hang in there.X\\n\\n\\nHi Shane. Wow 14 weeks?? And your still on 20mg. Has your gp not suggested you increase to 40mgs? I found 20mgs didn't work for me, only 40mgs. Once I was totally better for over 6 months he then reduced it to 20mgs. Which I was on for years. I don't know if you remember me saying that my citalopram had stopped working so I've been out onto duloxetine. Well I did 2 weeks on 30mgs and as I was still anxious and low mood he increased it to 60mgs. I've done 19 days on the 60mgs and what a difference. No anxiety and sleeping and eating well. And my mood has greatly improved. I'm up and out and about now and going back to work in 2 weeks. I definatley think 40mgs would be better. Are you taking anything else to help with the anxiety? I had diazepam for a short while which helped x x you will get there. Are you managing to get out and about?\\nHi Angie, I work and have not taken any time off thru out this ordeal. However it has been difficult...actually pretty much hell. My doc did suggest an increase or even trying a different ssri but I am so afraid of starting all over with side effects with no guarantee that something new or an increase will make a difference. It is bearable but unpleasant now. I am just hoping that an improvement is coming soon. Interesting that for some they get relief at 8 weeks or so while for others it takes months. Unfortunately I fall in the later group😣 thanks for your note I appreciate any comments,  suggestions this forum has been a godsend on those horrible Days!  Shane\\nYes you have a positive attitude so you will get there but it's s long road but so worth it to feel better.its my first time on medication like this 2.\\nHi Shane, I'm in a similair situation to you.  I've been on 20 mg Citalopram for 6 mnths now and although things are so much better and I have spells when I feel back to my old self i'm not totally back to normal all the time and still feel very low at times.  I have been considering upping my dose to 30 mg but also scared about the side-effects coming back, even if if is for a couple of weeks, it's hard to deal with when you have to get on with your life.  I'm managing now so don't want to rock the boat.  Maybe if you have some time booked off work you could up to 30 mg, that's what i'm planning in the next few couple of weeks but whether I will or not I don't know. Have you been up and down or just down all the time? Also have you improved since before you starting taking them? It's hard having to wait so long for results but these things do take time and I think the worse you were before taking the medication and the longer you were ill the longer it takes to get better.\\n\\n\\nHi I'm sorry it was a typo. Only twice.  I want to give 15 a fair shot. Based on what I've read here and other articles although dose is important it seems giving time is vital. Until the brain decides to desensitize itself from extra serotonin levels free flowing and tells the neuron cells to go ahead fire away more we will continue to feel off.  I'm on week 4 on the med 10mg and 4th day on 15. Had a really good day yesterday hoping for more of those   Mornings are the absolute worst.  Thank you all for the encouragement\\nStarting my 5th week today. Experienced 4 consecutive days of feeling really good at the end of week 4 into the weekend where we are in vacation as a family.\\nHi. So I don't know whether to laugh at this or be scared. Today I arrived home from our 5 day vacation, on my drive home the  palpitations  started. As I got home much of the old  anxiety  thoughts and feelings I left behind slowly started to creep up. As I saw  my inlaws (who live with us and my father in law recently sick with  cancer  which triggered this anxiety spell 2 months ago)\\nYes I'm actually in low dose of metaprolol beta blocker. If I take too much it makes my anxiety worse.\\nIs it normal to be freakin out 5 weeks into medicine? I had 4 really good days as I said. Now I have a meeting for this morning and I couldn't sleep and I'm feeling super panicky this morning like I don't want to face the people at work.\\n\\nAlso does the clock start all over again each time you go up strength? In other words I'm 5 weeks total into the drug but only about a week and a half on the 15mg's.  Does it take another 4 to 6 weeks on the new strength? I though because I had a month built up of the 10mg and because I felt so good 2 days after going up to 15 that I would just get better faster. But now I'm wondering if it takes more time. The nurse did say I should be in another 4 weeks when they increased it.\\nYou don't get better faster because of dosage increase and yes you are likely to go through renewed side effects. My doctor has to me to do dosage increases slowly over a period of time so that they aren't as much of a shock to my system and the effects aren't as abrupt but yes I do still get them to some degree.\\nOh ok. I just need to give the 15 more weeks then. Even if I do end up on 20. I'm so sensitive to this stuff. Today has been really rough.  I hope there's truly light at end of tunnel that makes this sacrifice worth it. Sometimes I think of just quiting and trying to face it on my own again. But then I will feel good and think oh maybe there's hope for me yet.\\nI know and I appreciate your encouragement. But I'm feeling so bad right now on the 15. Side effects worse and lasting longer I just don't see how I can go to 20 now.\\nI feel like side effects are so much worse at the 15. I can't get any relief for the last 48 hrs. I didn't experience that on 10. I at least had good evenings or afternoons.  Anyone go to 15 and feel it was too much then went back to 10mg? How did that work out? I feel like 2 weeks into 15 this making me worse not better.  Any thoughts greatly appreciate.\\n\\n\\nHi Gillian It's great that you post motivational stuff and I love reading what you do to Stuart the day and far far you have come , it gives me hope ! 5th week on Cut 20mg , had a couple of good days , today not so much but still loads better than I was . Tomorrow morning I'm going to try and get up when I wake even if it's early as it has been and do things to keep my brain occupied and hopefully start the day better, I'm sure it will. Start the councilloring on Wednesday so hopefully that will help too,  anxiety  and stupid thoughts in my head are still exhausting but have been trying meditation and reading up on excepting the thoughts and then thinking of something else, it takes practice but I'm happy to keep trying. Still positive that I will get ME back soon and counting the weeks lol. Thanks again for your posts and support  Matt\\nHi Gillian I've just downloaded them and will give them a go. Thanks again  Matt\\nHi Gillian and all So at the moment I am getting myself ready to go food shopping, a shop with people in and decisions to make lol , feeling anxious and sweaty , so silly isn't it , it's just a shop !  Got up straight away this morning had a cup of tea then went for a walk , determined to stay out of my bed today , sick of the sight of it to be honest 😄 Just about 5 and a half weeks into 20mg of Cit , obviously better than I was o know I am but still struggling but know by reading all the posts on here that it will keep getting better just keep telling myself I've made progress. Keep posting positive things people , it helps so much. Matt\\nHi Gillian Thank you again , it's so reassuring to hear your posts. I went shopping with my husband, it wasn't to bad , when we got home I cried for about 20 minutes , maybe it was the tension ? I am at five and a half weeks now on 20mg and do know I am improving but do you think at this stage I should be back to normal? It's such a terrible thing anxiety, it's getting easier but still have a head full of nonsense and churning tummy , not as bad though , should all that be gone now at this stage ? Thanks again for your support and encouragement, I feel so needy it's a bit pathetic at my age , I'm 51 , it's like a want someone to tell me it'll be ok even though I know i am better than I was , silly really 😊  Matt\\nHello. Feeling much better on the Cit 10mg.  I'm curious anyone else get PVCs  palpitations\\nHello. Still feel better but noticed a few blips this weekend. Sat afternoon felt side effects from the medicine which I have not felt at all in days. And this Mon morning woke up feeling nervous and anxious thinking of all things I have to do feeling overwhelmed and some intrusive thoughts. Haven't felt any of that for a long time.  I do have a lot going at home with a bedroom remodel and busy at work but when I feel good none of that tends to matter. Is this normal? This starts my 3rd week on the 10 consistently after coming off 15. Total of 7 weeks on the med.  thanks.\\nBut what I feel today is the side effects from the drug. Not high anxiety which is what I'm taking it for, if I go up the side effects on got worse. I was great all week long. The only change was taking a different pill at 10mg feel side effects in the 2nd day so I went back to cutting the 20mg in half since I knew that pill worked for me and today on day 2 back on original i feel my worse. I guess I can't change at all once I'm in a groove. I know not all pills are the same. I'm hoping it doesn't take me too many days to feel back on track like I've been for a while.\\nThat's true. I guess since this all started back in June I feel as though I've been on this for 2 months already not 3 weeks. I wasn't thinking that after being on 15 for week I was starting all over again at 10. Dr did say be patient and give another 4 weeks but that it shouldn't take that long start feeling better. And really it hasn't. Felt great last week and good the week before. I guess I thought I was in the clear.\\nHibGillian and all I haven't posted for a few days as I wanted my post to be positive and it is! I am now in week 7 of 20mg and life has started to get good again 👍 As you all know the first few weeks are really tough , anxiety and Cit side effects , felt like giving up so many times and felt I would never make progress and life would be that scary and horrible forever but it does get better I am proof of it ! From not being able to get out of bed to enjoying walks, doing my hair putting make up on and going to the shops , it's truly amazing . Don't get me wrong mornings can still be a challenge but I get up straight away, do the dishes which I purposely leave from the night before so I have something to do , go for a 20 minute walk and the meditate using the Head Space app, my day get better earlier and earlier every day . All the horrid side effects have gone just tired and some blurry vision and sometimes mild headaches but apart from that all is good and improving all the time. I am going back to work next week , phased in to start with , I have been off 6 weeks , scared but positive that I need structure again and this will help. Keep going everyone it WILL get better , be kind to yourself and get outside and walk it really helps. Thanks to this amazing website I have had great support when I thought I was alone , it has really helped me and of course you Gillian , you have been a big part of my belief that I would get better so thank you so much. Still got a way to go I know that and I will have down days but at least I know know that I will get there. Matt\\nYeah. How long do these blips usually last? I felt better last night around 11pm and was able to go back to sleep. This morning as soon as eyes opened started feeling bad again. I haven't that feeling and over a week and a half. Now all of sudden it's back for like 3 days now. I feel like I'm going backwards.\\nFeeling horrid today. I miss How felt last week. Can't believe how I can have so many consecutive good days and then bam the bottom drops out 3 days\\nWent back on 10mg on July 9th so 2 and half weeks on 10mg's. With my second week last week being the best I've felt in months. And now this week feeling bad again.\\nThat's great to hear Matt! Awesome.\\nHi Gillian So been back to work all week on reduced hours , was all going well but have felt anxiety return from Thursday!! Had a couple of brain zaps during a stressful conversation with a colleague and started all the worry and knotted stomach again , what's going on I was feeling so good and positive, I'm terrified I'm going back the way 😩 Obviously no where near as bad as I was but gutted I am feeling like this at week 9 on 20mg. Any suggestions?  Thanks  Matt\\nHi Gill This colleague is a gossip and he just wouldn't get it. I know you have talked about blips so I'm hoping that's what this is , my councillor said it's likely due to starting back at work and feeling very proud and happy with myself the first couple of days and then dipping down and expecting to feel that high and sence of achievement all the time but I'm back to reality now! I'm just trying to push on and pray I don't go back the way , that would be horrible and I just can't let that happen. Thank you for your encouragement again , hope I get back on track very soon. Matt\\nHappy for your recovery. I can understand how worst you would have felt during that phase\\nHello good morning. I just wanted to share today marks the end of week 4 for me. I started back at work this past week and did pretty good. Felt some  anxiety  but not as bad as 2 months ago. I continue to have ups and downs. Week 3 was the worse for me. These last few days thought the high morning anxiety is back and it really doesn't ware off until the evenings. I'm trying to stay busy for example I took the family out to dinner yesterday and we went to the monster trucks show. I started to feel good around 8pm. I end up feeling good and energetic through midnight til I fall asleep but then wake up early around 7:30am with high anxiety and  palpitations . I'm a bit frustrated and worried because I though by end of week 4 I would feel more relief. Any words of encouragement greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah  take mine in the morning 8am too\\nHi Gillian I made to week 6 and like Magic a gradually got better that weekend. Had the best week in months even the morning anxiety went away it was awesome!!!\\nRough day continues. Just high anxiety and fear feeling. Haven't had in a couple of weeks.\\n\\n\\nHow’s things going with you? Hope your keeping well. Matt\\n\\nHi Lois  I’ve had a few ups and downs , had my meds changed, it’s been a bumpy couple of months but I can say I’m starting to feel like I’m getting there 👍 will be starting CBT soon . Matt\\nOh that's great ..so they change you to what?just curious.\\nThey put me from cit to 50mg Sertraline and I had to up it each week till I got to 200mg , also 15mg Mirtazapine. I had a seizure so the psychiatrist dropped to 100mg Sertraline, it was all to much for me along with the Diazipan. Three weeks ago I had my Mirena coil replaced, it had been in for 7.5 years so had run out of Progesterone, to be honest I’ve felt calmer since I had that coil , maybe a lot of my problems have been hormonal, who knows but I’m weaning off the Diazipan over the next month then want to get down to the theroptic dose of Sertraline which is 50mg and hopefully by the summer I can stop the Mirtazapine, will have to see how things go but I have a lot of faith in CBT . Glad your keeping well 😁 Matt\\nBless your heart..you been thru alot...wow that's alot of meds..but Happy your doing better...\\n\\n\\nI'm fed up, I've been taking Citalopram for 6 weeks now. 2 weeks 10mg, 4 weeks 20mg. Before taking Citalopram I started with sickness that woke me up at 5am most days and left me flat out in bed all morning (this all came in after a breakup.) Sometimes I would feel sick again later in the day. They treated me for a stomach ulcers, a month later I wasn't improving much and have got depressed and been off work exhausted. The doctors then diagnosed me with  depression\\n\\n\\nMy husband is taking Celexa and it took him seven weeks to feel positive again. He had been on it before also and it worked quicker the first time but the important thing is, it did work again. You will feel better but it may take time.  I found these forums a lifeline during the dark times. They gave me hope.  Are you seeing a therapist? It may help you lay the demons of the past to rest.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm no fan of going on bigger dose!I don't even like to take a Tylenol much less anything else.\\nIsn't 60milligrams no longer recommended . because of heart issues world wide?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you so much Gillian for the reply!I think my last experience with this after a miscarriage and bad reaction to an antibiotic afterwards left me in a severe state that took two years to come out of!I felt so sure I would not survive I had my wedding photographer take a pic of my family with me in it so they could remember me!I was put on Celexa forty mg and never looked back!I was completely me again 100 percent and stayed on that for five years and was doing great,weaned off during my last pregnancy and it slowly all came back while I was training for a half marathon and pouring coconut oil in my coffe.It was like my body crashed and I was doing everything I could to breathe and tried Celexa had a bad reaction stopped it after two days and then went five months w nothing till last November started on low low dose of Prozac 5 mg and worked up to forty!I wasn't helping much at all and my doc switched me straight to Celexa and this time my response was great and that was July and I did well with the switch,felt better all July and all August on the forty and then about nine weeks in started dipping for two straight weeks and my doc said my OCD needed a higher dose so she moved me to 60 mg which I have been on for two weeks!I cannot understand how I did so well those 4 to 6 weeks on the 40 and went backwards badly!I tried to wait it out but after two weeks I needed to do something!My sleep at night is good!I can no longer nap during the day like I used to do .I use to require naps because I have four kids and keep super busy being a mom and I run my own business doing hair,so I make my own hours.Is two weeks on higher dose too soon to tell?Does it start over again!I don't have bodily  anxiety\\nI’ll check it out , thanks for the heads up it may help me. Matt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHi everyone first time posting. Long story short I have had a very rough last 4 years. I started nursing school my kids dad passed away also lost several other loved ones that I havnt even had time to grieve for yet and I have 6 children. Needless to say I have an extremely stressful life. I've made it to last semester of nursing school and was hit with severe dabilitating  depression\\n\\nweek 7 just starting to feel better (been to hell and back)  one day at a time.\\nI was in 20mg for 2 years then it was upped to 40mg this year. It was it that stage I decided after a month to come off it because I felt great. Big mistake. 2 months later I decided to go back on the 40mg. Omg it was like my body was hit with every emotion going and my bladder was out of control which I was told it was a side effect etc. Any it’s was decided to reduce to 20mg. Before I knew it I’d taken an overdose and was taken to hospital. This was down to going on the 40mg straight away. I was check out by the hospital counsellors.  I’m now back home and it’s 3 weeks since going back on Cit and each day appears to be getting better although I’m still crying in the morning which is to be expected.\\n\\nHi Gillian  Update to say I’m in my 4th week back on Cit 20mg and I’m slowly starting to feel better, not perfect. The mornings are still the worst with crying etc. But the good feelings are longer and by night time I feel my old self.  Please; for others in the same or similar position stick with the it, it does improve 👍🏻 #loveyourself\\nHi Gillian  Update to say I’m in my 4th week back on Cit 20mg and I’m slowly starting to feel better, not perfect. The mornings are still the worst with crying etc. But the good feelings are longer and by night time I feel my old self.  Please; for others in the same or similar position stick with the it, it does improve 👍🏻 #loveyourself\\n\\n\\nI am about to go on 20mg citalopram which will be my 2nd time on the drug. I was on 10mg for 3 years and stopped taking them a little over a year ago not on purpose , I guess because I felt fine I just forgot to take them and I’ve been fine up until recently I can see old habits creeping back . Anyway I went to dr they prescribed them to me again.  I didn’t really get side effects the 1st time round apart from heightened anxiety for a month or so. I’m so worried this time that I will get lots of side effects and they won’t work as well as they did before. I mainly suffer with health anxiety and general anxiety which in turn causes  depression . So starting any medication makes me freak out. Please tell me there is light at the end of the tunnel and they will work for me like they did before\\nThank you for your reply. I definitely shouldn’t have come off it and I think I will need them forever . However at the moment I’m not sure if I will ever feel better again. Mornings and evenings are worst I think that’s because I am at work in the day so that occupies my mind.  I’m snappy when at home because I’m tired and fighting this anxiety that I don’t even know why it is there in the first place. I’m struggling with my appetite at the moment , I love food so the fact I can’t seem to finish my evening meal like I used to is bothering me , although I’m not sure if the heat has something to do with it\\nHi Gillian , How are you? I’ve missed some tablets again 😩 I’m re starting them today and will set an alarm to remind me to take them .  Back at square one again 😔\\nHi Gillian  thank you for all your sharing and everyone else on here  I started back on Celexa for 2nd time after 2 years off.   So this time I started in beginning of June this year , had to start low does do to being very sensitive to meds  so my first does was 10 MG for 10 days then 15 MG for 8 days after that 20 MG for 4 weeks hopping it would work for me again being that I was on that same does 2 years back . But after 4 week I got worse on it , so Gp put me up on 30 MG . I have been on this does now for 7 weeks tomorrow and still going though lots of side effects  , like  anxiety  attacKS very  high and for almost all day , hot chest , shaking ,  dry mouth  and so on . So today my husband seeing me like this thinks I need to go down a bit like 25 MG . He thinks the 30mg did what it supports to do but is to high for me now . Do u think its wise to do so , being that in the last few day it has given me very high strung anxiety and much more . I do have lorazapam 0.5 for anxiety attacks but they only help so long . Also first time today it woke me up @ 5 am what it never done before in the 7 weeks on the 30 MG . Please give me ur input or someone on here that has gone though something similar like me . Sorry for this long letter , but scared of not coming out on this Celexa this time when it helped me the first time 2 years ago . sorry forgot to inform you never been depressed in my life and anxiety was first then the  depression  came after being sick for over 1 year or longer because Dr could not find what was wrong with me . In that time being home losing wait and letting my job go   the anxiety came and not much longer the depression.  So I got this year sick again and in that time of being sick the anxiety came and also depression. I better stop this letter now , sorry for any miss spell and for it being soooo ò o long of a letter  looking forward to any replies  thank you  babsyboo\\nI totally agree with Gillian ! I think you're GP has given you poor advice and moved you up far too quickly through the doses.  Your body hasn't had time to adjust to one dose before moving up again - it doesn't know where it is.

Your reply is so comforting and assuring, thanks again 😃 It seems that we are not the only ones that are experiencing such side effects, I've been searching the Internet since nearly a month, and I came across this discussion thread via Drugs. Our mates there are adding a new word -tics- to our (tremor-and shaking terms) to describe the feeling.

       "2  I was in the E.R. yesterday for bad  palpitations  but and all of my tests came back good so they sent me home but I have been having this sensation of my body being filled with icy hot or hot water being poured all over and then going icy cold. My body is physically cold to the touch too but I feel hot on the inside if that makes any sense. I have been having this for a few days now and was wondering if it could be a withdrawl symptom from Citalopram, which I only took for like 4 days and have been off for about the same amount of time now. I have been diagnosed with  anxiety  for years now and have never experienced this symptom and it is quite scary and concerning. I am trying to breathe through it in hopes that it will subside but it seems to come and go at random and out of seemingly nowhere which always catches me off guard. I am currently not taking any other meds except for hydrochlorothiazide 25mg for high blood pressure which I have been taking quite some time and never experienced this symptom from. I feel like I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown because I have been having all my other anxiety symptoms for months now and that is why my doctor started the citalopram in the first place, which I stopped because it only intensified my symptoms. Anyone else experience this icy hot sensation???\\n\\nHi Rachel i had the same for about 10 days 8 weeks into taking 20mg citalopram a day. Awful feeling.... It could be because you started and stopped or it could be just another symptom of  anxiety . I hope you feel better soon

       "3  I've been om citalopram for three weeks now for  anxiety . First 10mg for a week and a half and then 20mg for a week and a half. After going to 20mg I started to feel better, not cured of course but calmer. Over the weekend I felt almost normal, more in control than before. But today I'm terrible again. I never suffered with panic attacks but today I've felt like a panic attack is just about to come on. I get almost intense waves of what I can only describe as fear. I'm also on my monthly cycle at the moment. Does this sound like side effects, even after starting to improve? I'm trying very hard to be patient as I know recover is slow... Thanks as always for all the support\\nIve been on Cit for almost seven weeks.  Four days on 10mg, five weeks on 20mg, and just upped to 30mg five days ago.  I did what you did.  I improved greatly on the 20mg, feeling almost back to myself, then the day I started my cycle, I crashed.  All of my  anxiety\\nhang on you are having a blip on top of your monthly.best regards\\nThis was my first cycle since being on the meds. Well, I had a cycle as I started the meds so didnt pay attention as I was feeling awful from the side effects.  Most people seem to have blips right before their cycle. If mine was related, it didnt happen until the day the period actually started. I did have someone respond to me in another thread that said she gets blips for 3-4 days before her cycle, so I'd say hormones arent helping us.\\nLois, I wish I had found this forum before upping my dose to 30mg. I think I would have given 20 more time to work.  Now that Ive upped to 30, do you have an opinion on staying with it or going back down?  Ive been on it for five days.  I fear going back and forth may cause even more probelms  Thoughts?\\n\\nLois, How long were you on the 20 before you went back to 10?  Did you have to deal with side  effects all over again when you went back down?\\nHi Marketta\\nIt may be worth asking Doctor for some 10 mg propranolol (beta blocker) which do help dampen the panic feelings a bit as long as you dont have any medical problems that prevent taking this.  Doctors seem quite happy prescribing this instead of diazepam.\\nHi Marketta,i am not surprised you are getting side effects as you are not  giving  1 dose enough time to work.You need to be on 1 dose for 8/10 weeks for the medication to work in your system  before changing your dosage.\\ni was on 20 for one week .but my severe  headache\\n\\n\\n\\nSo how many days have you been on the 20mg only?\\nIve been keeping a journal and it looks like I stopped having the morning  anxiety\\n\\nMaybe we can touch base in a week and we'll both be feeling some improvement!\\nFeel free to private message me.  Weve got this!\\n\\n\\nim just finishing my monthly and wondered if it was related, bc this happened last month, but it seems worse today, and this is the last day of the monthly.  im sorry youre still feeling bad, too!  im really starting to question being on them.\\nabsolutely .\\nive been keeping a journal from day one.  it has been veey helpful!\\n\\nHey marketta! Hope you feeling better. I started celexa 20 mg since Feb 13 . Its been about 10 weeks. I have been feeling anxiety and get side effects still. I still have panicky feelings daily  with bad muscular tension. I went to a store today and felt very anxious and have some as i type this. Mornings are tough too to get going with all this. I have been getting down about this lately as well . My doc wants to up the dose to 30 mg but im torn on that as people say not to do it.\\nIm five weeks in on the upped dose of 30mg.  Im still not sure increasing was a wise choice, but am going to try and stick with it for 12 weeks and reassess.  What helps me when Im having the bad\\nHello Lois! I am going down on 20 mg celexa to 10 mg  and thinking of going off it. I been on 10 for a few days and feel unwell still.  I get intrusive thoughts as well. I was on celexa 20 mg for  a lmost 13 weeks with side effects from a to z  which i couldnt function on. I also get muscle pain and jaw pain with this med. I  am having a hard time doing things daily. I lay around a lot which i hate. I try to get out from time to time but struggle. My therapist thinks im getting worse  depression\\nperhaps if your doctor prescribe a benzo it would be much easier for you to cope with the side effects.\\nHey Lois! Arent benzos tough to take everyday? They are hard to come off of and addictive properties. I struggle everyday to function from mornings are terrible until evenings . I guess i need something to function.\\n\\n\\nHey Lois i went down to 10 mg from 20 mg.  Im kinda getting tired of this med and feeling this way. I am thinking of  getting off this stuff . Is that a decent dose? How did you know celexa started working when on benzos? The doc also mentioned something about cymbalta.

       "4  So I've just been to my gp for a check up after being on my citalopram 40mg for 5 weeks now. I told her that my side effects are starting to go now and that even though I've had a little bit of improvement, (chatting a bit more, less anxious, still feel low but not crying as much) I still feel like their is a lot of room for improvement. She told me that after 4-6 weeks I should notice a difference and said this was a good sign that my tablets are working and they should have reached a peak by now. What I'm confused about is, is this it then? I asked her if I would keep improving and I didn't really get a straight answer so I don't know if things will keep getting better as time goes on and will I still start to feel better because I feel like I'm no where near what I was like before. She didn't offer a change just told me I will need to take them for atleast 6 months-1 year. So will i keep improving for a bit because I really don't feel like I'm half way their yet.\\npointless asking a doctor they know nothing about  antidepressants\\nyes, well too early to tell! these are powerful drugs, put it this way i reduced from 10mg to 6mg 11 months ago and only just starting to have better days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntotally understand.may i ask what made you stay on them for so long if you werent really getting benefits from them?\\nhave you ever heard of polydrugging? its what doctors are good at, basically the first drug i got put on caused a symptom the docs think its real so give you another on top which causes another symptom until the patient doesnt know what is causing what, it never stops unless you end up being rushed to hospital with a suspected  stroke\\nyes i totally understand that polydrugging after my  doctor try to misdiagnose me for having  arthritis .and trying to give me drugs for it .thank god i was aware of all the side effects n meds interactions.other wise i would of probably had all kinds of poop going on in my system.when i told my doctor that she was wrong she couldnt believe that i said no to her arthritis meds.\\n\\ni bet .after all these decades that the ssris have been on the market you think they would know something.other than oh yoh will be find in two weeks.i guess they dont want to verbally scare their patients.with med drama.\\n\\ntook me eight months .i know everyones chemistry is different .and iam still improving after been on them for roughly 3years.\\nmost definitely.\\nboth.\\n\\noh my goodness it was and is the best feeling ever.\\nyes for 8full months.\\n\\n\\ncompletely gone.that is why i would never come off .cant risk that ant feeling terrorizing me again.\\nI've been on citalopram a total of 7 months now, I was initially on 10mg, they increased me to 20mg and I stayed on that for 5.5 months. I found that the 20mg seemed much to high for me, it made me numb emotionally, and just felt weird so I reduced to 15mg, and  so far and the past week I feel much more like my old self. So it's really a guessing game as to the right dose, and how long it takes to feel 'much' better. You will have periods of feeling better, and then a dip, then feeling better, to where the dips happen rarely and the majority of time you feel good. Don't get discouraged if you have a dip just bare through it and tell yourself its temp and you're still on the path to feeling better! My doctor also told me 6-8 weeks for full effect, that is so far from true for most people, most of the time. I would say you should 'start' having some good days by then, and they will continue to increase for months, some people have said up to 7-8 months. So just give it time, stick with it. Best Wishes!\\n\\ni totally understand the adrenaline drama. i had that for 8months . it would start in my stomach and it would end on top of my head the most bizzare feeling in the world.\\n\\n\\nyes despair is definitely the correct definition.like omg what is happening why do i feel like this.etc.\\nAh, the good old doctors advice again ……. It may be that the meds reach their peak by 4-6 weeks (I’m not a medic so have no idea) but that doesn’t mean you will feel well by 4-6 weeks. These meds like all SSRI’s are slow working - it took me 6 months to feel better.  No this is not your maximum - you have a long way to go yet.  4-6 weeks is really early. Even though you may feel some improvement already, don’t be fooled, because usually recovery comes and goes - and that means the symptoms come back time after time (setbacks / blips).  This is completely normal and is just the way the meds work. So yes - you will keep improving, but as said, don’t be too surprised if you start feeling ill again.  Its perfectly normal.  Just keep going and those setbacks will finally cease to come. Don’t be in a rush either - let recovery come and go and you’ll find over time you’ll feel better and better.\\nMwahahahahaha …… 😅 😅 me, celeb?  Just an ordinary pleb lol. Anxiety is a strange condition to have and its just as strange when recovering, as it foxes people into thinking they’re not getting better.  But the meds are working despite how bad you might feel. Glad you’re feeling some relief and yes, it should improve much more over time. Let us know how it goes. ps ……. shall I send you my autograph hahaha 🤣\\n📖 🖍 .... there you go 🤣 I've just seen people go through what I did many moons ago ... thinking the same, going down the wrong path, feeling the same feelings ..... so just like to lend a hand and pass on what I learnt as I recovered. Yes the anxiety will come and go, and seems for no reason.  Its actually your reaction to it that counts - freak about it, try and run away, try and stop it and it'll just cling all the more - but letting it be, work with it, take it with you (however bad it feels), acknowledge it and don't start analysing it then it will lose its power and ease off.  Its not easy, but thats the way forward. Also don't overdo things - when you've got anxiety it means your body has reached its overload with stress and your body is tired, so as you recover take things easy, slow yourself down and be gentle on yourself. Yes your mindset will change a lot - when you're having good times your body will feel calm and your thoughts light and lifting - then when anxiety hits you it seems all you've felt yesterday has gone out the window today as you feel frightened, think negative thoughts and can't see a way forward. Its just anxiety that brings these effects with it - so an anxious body = an anxious mind and a calm body = a calm mind. One more thing - don't hope tomorrow is a good day, because if it isn't then you'll feel even more disappointed and frustrated.  Instead accept whatever comes and just know that the anxiety will pass ..... maybe tomorrow, maybe next week or the week after.  Let it come and go as it pleases.\\nAnxiety is always worse in the mornings - apparently its to do with Cortisol being at its highest first thing when waking. Bad mornings and calmer evenings is exactly how recovery worked for me - by the evening I’d feel a little calmer, and over time I began to look forward to my evenings as they got better.  Those good feelings gradually crept into more into my day so I’d start feeling more at ease earlier and earlier - and around 6 months I finally started waking with no anxiety.  Throughout that time I still had blips where I felt rubbish all day, but those days passed. Yes it is tiring - its always 3 steps forward and 2 steps back … all the way. You will get better - just let recovery come to you - it will.\\nHi Potatoghost Just been reading your initial post and was wondering whether your doctor started you on 40mg or whether you have increased to 40mg. It seems such a high dose if that's what you've started on. In either case it may be worth discussing with your doctor whether a dose adjustment may suit you better.\\nhave you asked the doctor for a short term benzo??\\ni call it impending doom, at one point i was terrified of everything, scared to snap a bar of dark chocolate (seriously) ive been like that many months, it does ease\\nHi\\nhigh blood pressure meds are good for folks who have speaking to

still only watch certain things as some trigger me, how long were you on mirtazapine for?\\nyes i agree, ive come off mirt 3 times the first 2 were easy the last time was hell it lasted only 4 months, also from what ive read on here some peoples cit withdrawal sound less severe than others ive read elsewhere i literally have 100s of symptoms, just shows how everyone is different\\nyou have to remember every time you fiddle with the dose is like starting the process all over again for most folks.\\n\\n\\ndo not be afraid to take your benzo your doctor prescribe.why suffer?\\nive been in withdrawal in one form or another fir nearly 2 years, adding meds and changing doses will mess with your CNS so be careful\\ni know for a fact the benzo will not make you depress .i would be more worry about changing meds or increasing meds.\\nHi Potatoghost\\ni have a mirtazapine withdrawal support group on facebook\\n\\nbingo\\ni tell you one thing without that benzo i would of ended in a mental institution.at first they wouldnt give it to me  after five months of suffering they finally approve my benzo. only use it for one year .the lowest dose .i just stop taking it  one day no withdrawl no drama for me .\\n\\nnot anymore docs here in the uk rarely give them out as theyre so addictive even short term, i have 42 untouched diazepam i wont take them as took them for 5 days and had terrible withdrawals for months also they make you feel down when theyre wearing off, of course everyone is different but personally its a no from me! also cns is your central nervous

we may not feel like go for a walk or eat healthy but we need count down in our head 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 and when we hit 1 get up and do what we need to do . it be hard . you will not like it at first but overtime it work . you retrain your brain by your action . you can not think your way out of anxiety . you have to take action . fake it till you become it . hi just wonder how you get g on , i be

good to hear a positive story . i be on citalopram for years and be mainly fine , so i reduce them due to hunger issue . about a month ago i crash badly , i have be back on them for a few weeks just over 2 weeks at 20mg . i felt better last week , back at work , almost normal . feel worse again this week , depress and feel like part of my personality be miss i have be on 10mg for 3 wks now and wonder when i will start to feel myself again . yes i saw that . it be just dissapointing as i begin to feel ok last week but feel rubbish again , be cry last night . but i do have a stressful day on

, hi elliot thank so much for your encourage word . it be so hard to remember when you be feel bad . at each stage of improvement i feel like this be go to be it forever and i never learn but i need to acknowledge that it be improvement . i have be write a journal to help me look back and see how bad i be . i feel fine now , i usually feel fine from lunchtime but off in the mornings . i take it at night , which be what i do the last time i be on it . it be make me very sleepy when i first start and i do not have any problems sleep on it . hi gillian i be out on 10mg for 2 wks but i be give 20on monday but scar to take it . i speak to doctor today and she say go up to 20 tomoro because it be more therapeutic . up till now but say he felt awful last night have morbid thoughts , panicky . . and anxiety worse , do not know wether to wring drs tomorrow or what . . tell him to hang in in there and take one day at a time - worst of the side effect be usually out of the way around 2 weeks but the full benefit of citalopram can vary with different people which be usually measure in months . good luck but start get low , so she put him on citalapran 20mg i be so worry about him hes lose 2 stone , get a feel in be stomach can not eat , never be poorly in his life , never have a day off work . . he be put hi , like gillian days you will get lot of advice , personal stories and lot of support on this forums . try not to dwell on things and look forward to better time ahead . personally i lose 2 . 5 stone last year and everyone on here will tell you that they have be through hell to get to the other side but good time lay ahead . try and get him to manage healthy food , meditation and mindfulness really help me too . hi gillian you want me to repost this post under here about reason why meds take so long and why you feel rubbish be warn folks . . . . . . its a l-o-n-g post hi everyone , here s something i find online which you may find intersting . its about why you feel so rubbish when take these meds , why your mood be up and down , why it take so long and the process it all go through . sorry its a long post . when start an ssri or increase it be dose often make people feel really rubbish , which can cause a great deal of stress as you begin to wonder whats happen , why be their illness get worse , be these meds work etc . somone recently post a great post explain what these meds do in our brain , and i d like to add further to this . so , as already post ... . . the brain be basically a big dense bundle of nerve which carry electrical signal around our brain and body . the nerve cells don t touch each other , leave a small gap between each cell , call a synapse . so how do signal get from one nerve to another ? neurotransmitters be chemicals release by nerve cells that tell a neighbour nerve cell to pass the signal along . a bite like pass the parcel . serotonin be one such neurotransmitter . so when an electrical signal reach the end of a nerve cell that deal with serotonin , that cell release serotonin into the gap synapse , which then cross the gap and interact with the nearby nerve cell and tell it to pass the signal along . once the serotonin have do it be job , the serotonin be then reabsorb from the gap so that no more signal be pass until the next one come down the nerve . ssris , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors interfere with this reabsorbtion process and thus it stay in the gap longer , which equate to more serotonin and more signal . so further on from there ... . . why do you feel so rubbish ? so , along with the release of serotonin , and reabsorb it , nerve cells also have part that detect an increase in serotonin level and tell the nerve cell to stop produce anymore serotonin until the level drop . these be call autoreceptors , which be the reason you feel like so rubbish . so the ssri will increase the amount of serotonin that s gather in the synapses between nerve cells , but unfortunately the autoreceptors of the nerve cell pick up on this increase and tell the nerve cell to stop produce serotonin . the result of this be that when you first start take an ssri your serotonin level drop . how do they go up again ? eventually with continuous use of the ssri medication , the autoreceptors become desensitise , that be to say they have continually tell the nerve cell to stop produce serotonin but yet serotonin be still there . in short they simply give up . they stop tell the nerve cell to stop produce serotonin and your serotonin level start to increase . this desensitisation take time , it do not happen over night and it will not even begin to happen until the ssri level have stabilise . this be why you feel so rubbish , and be why your mood drop and your anxiety increase also fuelledd by the fear of not know whats go on . your mood will be up and down as the seronotin continue to try to stablise . so , to summarise : ssris cause your serotonin level to drop when you first start take them . your serotonin level will not rise until the autoreceptors in your brain have stop work become desensitise , all of which take lot and lot of time . everyone be different , so for some it can be many weeks and other months . i hope this help some people to understand what these meds be do and why you do not get instant result , compare to other meds that work in different ways which be the reason they can have a more immediate effect benzos for example . how be you now ? it could be weeks or months till he feel better , he frighten he want be ever be able to go back to work hes only be on them 4 days , l feel sorry for him hes such a strong man hi merry christmas . tell your husband to give it time and allow the meds to do there job . i know things look bleak and there seem no end in sight button there be . i have be to work today . after 12 weeks of these meds . even at 10week i think i would never feel better . hello i have be in citropalm for 3 weeks and be feel a bite better last week than i do this week . im on 10 mg but go up to 20 tomoro i hop to start feel myself very soon . what be your husband on what mg . i have never have anything like this before either and i be off work 3 wks now . stop take them , his anxiety be worse dry mouth , only be hi merry christmas , i be on them 7 years and come of them worst thing i do . how long be you off of the meds before reinstate ? hope you see this as i be afraid to go back on after be off for 8 months . long story short , they work for me for years then stop work , doc up the dose and they work again , and then stop work , so i go cold turkey . it be be hell . want to reinstate but have read it can make it all worse . your story make me feel better about go back on them . just wonder about your reinstatement dose and how long between not take and reinstate . thank so much . hi there ! well i be only off them very briefly in 2000 . then go straight back on the 20mgs . so i have be on 20mgs for 17 years and they have keep me go . so 4 weeks ago i have to have hem up to 40mgs due to move house , job etc and it kick everything off . not be like this for 17 years ! ! i be still quite anxious and get up in the morning be a struggle . . but hopefully the next couple of weeks they will start to work . i hate this feel so much as i feel like it be such an effort to just get through the day . keep in touch and let me know how you get on . hi nicola99452 may i ask what the name of the antihistamine be by wednesday dry mouth and edgie thursday and friday suicidal thoughts wrang drs say stay on them but if to bad come off them , saturday fine my old husband back till dinner time go right down , we end up at crisis health center , they speak for two hours to him dr explain about citalopran , sunday morning he wake up frighten to death , couldnt see a way out of this , cry sweat shake suicidal , get up didnt take cit till dinner felt bad this morning but not as bad as yesterday hi merry christmas sorry to hear things have be really rough for you both . your husband really need to take the citalopram at the same time every day . it be really important to keep the level steady in his system rather than take it erratically . have he get some diazepam to help with the anxiety panic . it be a life saver for me . gerry hi merry christmas . i be sorry to hear he be have such a rough time , it take somebody to be very brave to admit that they be have suicidal thoughts but i can not stress the importance enough of take your citalopram at the same time everyday . you need to be really strict with this , he be only make it harder for himself . what you should both focus on be that infact he have a good day on saturday , and try not to get dishearten that it only last a small amount of time , those days will get easier . by day 7 i be ready to throw in the towel , but now i be on day 16 and extremely glad i do not . your husband need to talk to somebody regard the think s hes have to ensure he understand what be happen . i doubt that your husband be actually suicidal , i certainly know i have suicidal thoughts during the worst part of citalopram but when your at that level of anxious its very easy to confuse the fear of become suicidal not be able to cope with that of be suicidal . this will get better , i be look forward to hear about his recovery in the come weeks . i understand that as a man , my natural reaction be to help myself get better . i be absolutely work motivate and terrible when i be off for anything , be anxiety only make that worse due to the nature of the illness . i want your husband to know that i have be through what he be experience , he might not believe me but what he be experience be most definetly temporary , and you can 100 blame the citalopram for it because it be scientifically prove that these drug make you feel worse before they make you feel better . can i suggest that you look into a book call dare , its available on amazon prime and i find it really help me understand and cope with the first few weeks , and it be also extremely therapeutic to read about the techniques you can use to help yourself recover . your husband most likely will be struggle to keep busy at the moment , so the bad days probably feel like they be go to last forever . i think its really important that you continue to do gentle activities when in your worst state , this will not be easy but i utilise the mentalityy well i feel so bad so this really can not make me feel any worse so why the hell not . gentle walk , watch a funny tv show , visit close family and friends who can offer support , draw . please take the tablet at the same time everyday , i do not sleep well with them at the start so i take them in the morning with breakfast . have a look at mind mental health charity to see if they can support your husband in the early days of this medication . progress be go to be slow , and there be go to be setbacks but he need to keep remind himself that this be a temporary problem cause by his body s inability to calibrate to the drug any quicker . when i felt awful last week , i tell myself this statement probably over 500 time a day just to put things into perspective . all the best . ing word , he have felt abit better since yesterday afternoon , bite frighten this morning again but it pass , finger cross the worse might be over , see drs tomorrow say hes felt gillian , thank your for post your success story , it make me feel a lot better read your post and all the comment . i be on celexa for the 3rd time . be on it a few years ago then think i do not need it anymore . anxiety come back about a year ago , try celexa again but stop after 6 weeks bc i do not feel a difference . then try 3 other meds but none work so now i be try celexa again . you be right , i think i will wait a bite longer . i get a new gp and i do not think she really know what she be do . when she prescribe it she tell me to start with 10mg and increase 10mg each week until i start feel better or get to 40mg . which i know be way too fast because i have go through this before . my last doctor be great but he move to a different location . morning , have terrible night , suicidal thoughts of harm hiself , he wasnt so depress before he start them . just hope he can i have be on 20 mg for 7 weeks . have not have much of a change . do most people take 20 mg or 40mg . how to determine if you need to up the dose or do an add on . i be not feel too good this week , low and tearful . the issue i have be deal with be that i be 33 and never have a boyfriend , i feel like a freak and that it will never happen . it be probably the hi nicola , i be feel really stange now . i have periods of feel ok last week but i feel worse this week . i think cos i be think about the relationship thing again . i do not feel like myself , a bite tearful again . i get this weird cold feel behind the front of my shoulder and in my chest and feel fearful . sorry to go on and on . hi nicola , just read your post and it sound like you be in a bad place at the moment , but remember it be just a moment in your life . it will not be forever . things change from one day to the next and one minute you can be single and a couple of years down the line in a relationship with kid , believe me that be what it be like for my sister . you look so pretty on your profile picture you should surely have no difficulty find a boyfriend - it must just be a confidence thing . thank you . i do not understand why it have not happen yet , i have have so much rejection . but i think i give off the wrong vibes . i do not know how to change it . i feel quite tearful at the moment . i be at work but i will probably go home and cry . hi nicola sorry to butt in on your conversation with everyone , but want to say that my son have a breakdown just over 2 years ago because he be not good at socialise and have a bad relationship which make him ill . he start meds too , be very ill and could not work for 4 months - his doctor say to step outside his comfort zone a little . i get him interest in music african drum and guitar . . . not together mind and slowly he felt able to go to the group alone . he also join badminton and slowly he begin to heal . it take him 9 months to recover and be now back to normal . go out to social group he meet a lovely girl and they be still together and he still continue to play music . he will never be a social butterfly , as still struggle in some company , but he be go out and next week they be off to italy for a holiday . join something will find friends first . . . . . . and who know what will follow . i work with my husband for 2 years before we get together . . . . . again we be friends first . sometimes that special person be right under your nose and you do not realise it i have try things like that but nothing yet . i just feel so low and cry again , i can not see any hope or point . i be see the dr on friday again but i be scar she will up my dose and the hunger problems i have before will come back . you be not in the right place at the moment . you need to look after yourself first . . . . . join some group maybe something completely different to what you would ever think of do should be for yourself first . this will help you to heal too . the meds will kick in and you will feel in a much better place . that person will come along some day . many years ago when i be recover i start dance class . what a way to build confidence ! ! 16 years later i be now a dance teacher and i love watch how new students grow with confidence - all shape and size my best dancer be over 20 stone . . . . . . such an amaze woman . they do something for themselves and become absorb in the music and movement . i have one shy student in her 30 s who be be internet date , still look for the one , but say dance have make her feel different about herself recovery on these meds be slow - it often get worse before it get better , so i be not surprise you will feel at an all time low at the moment . it really do get better . your doctor can suggest you increase your dose , but at the end of the day its your body and completely your choice . they can only advise . thank for share how i will your son be but most of all his success story that be great hi nicola before i start citalopram my confidence and self esteem have be shatter with be bully by 2 girls where i work i be in a right mess . i have be single for 3 years but once the meds get into my system everything else start to get better and i make still single but i know i will meet someone one day and so will you but like people have say you need to get yourself better first and it will all fall into place i be better for age and it do not fall in to place . so i be not that confident it will . i now you be try to help but when it be never happen for you you can not imagine it ever will . unfortunately after over 2 months i be not feel better and just do not want to get out of bed . do not care about anything . dr have change my meds which i start in a few days . i be quite scar to be honest . hey nicola , oh nicola , i be sorry . when i restart these meds it take much , much longer than the first time , and probably be about 7-8 months until they kick in and i have a completely different experience 2nd time . i really hope the transition be as smooth as can be . post back here when you be ready - everyone be here for you . yeah i do not think i can do 7-8 months feel like this . at the intensity you be feel the symptoms , i do not blame you . sorry to post on such a old post but would love your thoughts . . . i have take citalopram 2 time before with amaze result after a rough initial month . come off it late last year honestly believe i do not need to be on it . anyway late feb be strike back down , doctor tell me to go back on them and say i can stay on them this time . i start on 20mg and have a rough couple of weeks , then start to feel much better , even remember think wow they have never work this quickly before , then stupidly i up the dose to 40mg as i have be on that before , side effect come crash back , but then after 2 weeks again i begin to feel better . . . until i saw a doctor who i ask for reassurance because even though i be feel better i want reassurance it would work as well as it have do previously , she do not give me that reassurance and tell me that sometimes your hormones can change . . . since then i come crash back down . . . 3 and a bite weeks ago i decide to give up on it and lower my dose to 20mg to start weening but now i be in 2 mind whether to stick or move on . i want to stick as work amaze in the past and do not want to put myself through the whole start again with another drug . . . could it not be work as well this time simply because i have mess with the dose too much and not allow it to settle ? or would you think it be simply not work this time ? all in all i have be take it 11 weeks , break down as 2 on 20mg then 5 weeks and a couple of days on 40mg and now 4 weeks on 20mg . . . i think i be better than i be but everyday be still a struggle . . . not sure why it either be not work or be take longer to work this time ? thank you hi i be on lustral for 15 years andrea have to

not as tire in the day but i have sleep problems so do not want to mess with that as i be ok take it in the morning . hi everyone . im so glad i find this discussion . i have be on a therapeutic dose of 20mgs of citalopram for the last 18 years after have the most horrendous p n depression . i do come off them for a short time but end up relapse when my dad pass away . anyway , i have just have quite a few major change in my life and start with panic attack , anxiety , insomnia , depression and no appetite at all . so i be today on week 4 of 40mgs of citalopram and still do not feel as though i be there yet . im still struggle to eat , however i can sleep which be an improvement . the worst time for me be first thing in a morning . i struggle to get out of the bed and do feel quite nauseous and tire till late afternoon . as i be write this i feel okay . i be nowhere near as bad as i be with the p n depression as back then i could not even look at my face in the mirror as it be not my face . have anyone else experience depersonalisation and the feel that they be not themselves . this for me be the worst bite of depression . thank gilliam it do take a while do not it . so happy you be much better and thank for the positive story hi everyone , i have be on and off of celexa for years . the first time i take it i be 21 and stay on until i be 24 but gain about forty pound . i be sure it be not just the medicine but it definitely increase my appetite . i go on it again for a short period in 2006 to deal with some situational anxiety but once i switch job my doc pull me off of it because she felt it be all job relate . so in 2012 i be go through a rough patch . . . have an occular migraine , go through a long period of date the wrong guy , and be deal with the fear of lose my grandmother who be very ill . i start at 10 mg for a week and then move to 20 mg . it take about 3 to 4 weeks to start to feel better but a lot of my situations start to work themselves out meet a new boyfriend , figure out what my migraine be , etc . i drop to 10 mg in 2014 because i be concern about the weight gain all the best ! shane hi shane . i too be exactly the same as you . just hang on in there get through each day . friends keep ask , you get any plan for this week i say , i be just gon na try and get through it to which they say sorry . it be difficult for some to understand be not it . i be week 5 now . although last time which be a long time ago be around the 8 9 week mark when i saw some good days . so keep go shane . we have to . it be the only way to beat it and come out the other side stronger than ever x x you be certainly correct we just need to keep on fight thru the tough days to get to the better days ahead . yes we do . we will get there ! just try and keep positive too and say nice things to yourself . apparently it get into the subconscious and help with heal . keep in touch hi shane hi sarah , not happy that you be have these side effect but glad that it be not only me . . . if that make any sense ! i saw my doctor today and she confirm what gillian and katecogs often say . it get better with time and just stay the course because gradually we will see improvements . it be too soon to consider a different ssri or to up the dose . doc suggest at review at 12 weeks to see where things be at . i have go this far so i can tough it out for 3 more weeks . bloody hard some days though ! hang in ! shane shane hi shane , what do you think about this i have take citalopram 2 time before with amaze result after a rough initial month .

to stay strong or be strong , i think unless you have be through this you do not even know what be strong be haha hi gillian , at what stage be you sure you be feel better ? stay strong , you can get there . shane i be hop 12 weeks will be a milestone for better days to kick in . shane hi shane . shane hi thank you for this post it give me hope . i be on week 3 and the mornings be just horrible , can not wait to feel better . this positive post help me no end thank ! hi gillian i be nearly at week 3 , feel so awful but read these post be keep me go . just want to feel free from this anxiety and depression but i know i will just get to wait and let the ctl take effect . thank hi gillian thank again . i be new to this site so just get use to find any reply ! matt hi i have be on cit for 4 months and the first few weeks be the worst but i be nearly back to my old self . tell him to hang in there . x hi shane . wow 14 weeks ? ? and your still on 20mg . have your gp not suggest you increase to 40mgs ? i find 20mgs do not work for me , only 40mgs . once i be totally better for over 6 months he then reduce it to 20mgs . which i be on for years . i do not know if you remember me say that my citalopram have stop work so i have be out onto duloxetine . well i do 2 weeks on 30mgs and as i be still anxious and low mood he increase it to 60mgs . i have do 19 days on the 60mgs and what a difference . no anxiety and sleep and eat well . and my mood have greatly improve . i be up and out and about now and go back to work in 2 weeks . i definatley think 40mgs would be better . be you take anything else to help with the anxiety ? i have diazepam for a short while which help x x you will get there . be you manage to get out and about ? hi angie , i work and have not take any time off thru out this ordeal . however it have be difficult . . . actually pretty much hell . my doc do suggest an increase or even try a different ssri but i be so afraid of start all over with side effect with no guarantee that something new or an increase will make a difference . it be bearable but unpleasant now . i be just hop that an improvement be come soon . interest that for some they get relief at 8 weeks or so while for others it take months . unfortunately i fall in the later group thank for your note i appreciate any comment , suggestions this forum have be a godsend on those horrible days ! shane yes you have a positive attitude so you will get there but it be s long road but so worth it to feel better . its my first time on medication like this 2 . hi shane , i be in a similair situation to you . i have be on 20 mg citalopram for 6 mnths now and although things be so much better and i have spell when i feel back to my old self i be not totally back to normal all the time and still feel very low at time . i have be consider up my dose to 30 mg but also scar about the side-effects come back , even if if be for a couple of weeks , it be hard to deal with when you have to get on with your life . i be manage now so do not want to rock the boat . maybe if you have some time book off work you could up to 30 mg , that be what i be plan in the next few couple of weeks but whether i will or not i do not know . have you be up and down or just down all the time ? also have you improve since before you start take them ? it be hard have to wait so long for result but these things do take time and i think the worse you be before take the medication and the longer you be ill the longer it take to get better . hi i be sorry it be a typo . only twice . i want to give 15 a fair shoot . base on what i have read here and other article although dose be important it seem give time be vital . until the brain decide to desensitize itself from extra serotonin level free flow and tell the neuron cells to go ahead fire away more we will continue to feel off . i be on week 4 on the med 10mg and 4th day on 15 . have a really good day yesterday hop for more of those mornings be the absolute worst . thank you all for the encouragement start my 5th week today . experience 4 consecutive days of feel really good at the end of week 4 into the weekend where we be in vacation as a family . hi . so i do not know whether to laugh at this or be scar . today i arrive home from our 5 day vacation , on my drive home the palpitations start . as i get home much of the old anxiety thoughts and feel i leave behind slowly start to creep up . as i saw my inlaws who live with us and my father in law recently sick with cancer which trigger this anxiety spell 2 months ago yes i be actually in low dose of metaprolol beta blocker . if i take too much it make my anxiety worse . be it normal to be freakin out 5 weeks into medicine ? i have 4 really good days as i say . now i have a meet for this morning and i could not sleep and i be feel super panicky this morning like i do not want to face the people at work . also do the clock start all over again each time you go up strength ? in other word i be 5 weeks total into the drug but only about a week and a half on the 15mg s . do it take another 4 to 6 weeks on the new strength ? i though because i have a month build up of the 10mg and because i felt so good 2 days after go up to 15 that i would just get better faster . but now i be wonder if it take more time . the nurse do say i should be in another 4 weeks when they increase it . you do not get better faster because of dosage increase and yes you be likely to go through renew side effect . my doctor have to me to do dosage increase slowly over a period of time so that they be not as much of a shock to my system and the effect be not as abrupt but yes i do still get them to some degree . oh ok . i just need to give the 15 more weeks then . even if i do end up on 20 . i be so sensitive to this stuff . today have be really rough . i hope there be truly light at end of tunnel that make this sacrifice worth it . sometimes i think of just quit and try to face it on my own again . but then i will feel good and think oh maybe there be hope for me yet . i know and i appreciate your encouragement . but i be feel so bad right now on the 15 . side effect worse and last longer i just do not see how i can go to 20 now . i feel like side effect be so much worse at the 15 . i can not get any relief for the last 48 hrs . i do not experience that on 10 . i at least have good even or afternoons . anyone go to 15 and feel it be too much then go back to 10mg ? how do that work out ? i feel like 2 weeks into 15 this make me worse not better . any thoughts greatly appreciate . hi gillian it be great that you post motivational stuff and i love read what you do to stuart the day and far far you have come , it give me hope ! 5th week on cut 20mg , have a couple of good days , today not so much but still load better than i be . tomorrow morning i be go to try and get up when i wake even if it be early as it have be and do things to keep my brain occupy and hopefully start the day better , i be sure it will . start the councilloring on wednesday so hopefully that will help too , anxiety and stupid thoughts in my head be still exhaust but have be try meditation and read up on except the thoughts and then think of something else , it take practice but i be happy to keep try . still positive that i will get me back soon and count the weeks lol . thank again for your post and support matt hi gillian i have just download them and will give them a go . thank again matt hi gillian and all so at the moment i be get myself ready to go food shop , a shop with people in and decisions to make lol , feel anxious and sweaty , so silly be not it , it be just a shop ! get up straight away this morning have a cup of tea then go for a walk , determine to stay out of my bed today , sick of the sight of it to be honest just about 5 and a half weeks into 20mg of cit , obviously better than i be o know i be but still struggle but know by read all the post on here that it will keep get better just keep tell myself i have make progress . keep post positive things people , it help so much . matt hi gillian thank you again , it be so reassure to hear your post . i go shop with my husband , it be not to bad , when we get home i cry for about 20 minutes , maybe it be the tension ? i be at five and a half weeks now on 20mg and do know i be improve but do you think at this stage i should be back to normal ? it be such a terrible thing anxiety , it be get easier but still have a head full of nonsense and churn tummy , not as bad though , should all that be go now at this stage ? thank again for your support and encouragement , i feel so needy it be a bite pathetic at my age , i be 51 , it be like a want someone to tell me it will be ok even though i know i be better than i be , silly really matt hello . feel much better on the cit 10mg . i be curious anyone else get pvcs palpitations hello . still feel better but notice a few blips this weekend . sit afternoon felt side effect from the medicine which i have not felt at all in days . and this mon morning wake up feel nervous and anxious think of all things i have to do feel overwhelm and some intrusive thoughts . have not felt any of that for a long time . i do have a lot go at home with a bedroom remodel and busy at work but when i feel good none of that tend to matter . be this normal ? this start my 3rd week on the 10 consistently after come off 15 . total of 7 weeks on the med . thank . but what i feel today be the side effect from the drug . not high anxiety which be what i be take it for , if i go up the side effect on get worse . i be great all week long . the only change be take a different pill at 10mg feel side effect in the 2nd day so i go back to cut the 20mg in half since i know that pill work for me and today on day 2 back on original i feel my worse . i guess i can not change at all once i be in a groove . i know not all pills be the same . i be hop it do not take me too many days to feel back on track like i have be for a while . that be true . i guess since this all start back in june i feel as though i have be on this for 2 months already not 3 weeks . i be not think that after be on 15 for week i be start all over again at 10 . dr do say be patient and give another 4 weeks but that it should not take that long start feel better . and really it have not . felt great last week and good the week before . i guess i think i be in the clear . hibgillian and all i have not post for a few days as i want my post to be positive and it be ! i be now in week 7 of 20mg and life have start to get good again as you all know the first few weeks be really tough , anxiety and cit side effect , felt like give up so many time and felt i would never make progress and life would be that scary and horrible forever but it do get better i be proof of it ! from not be able to get out of bed to enjoy walk , do my hair put make up on and go to the shop , it be truly amaze . do not get me wrong mornings can still be a challenge but i get up straight away , do the dish which i purposely leave from the night before so i have something to do , go for a 20 minute walk and the meditate use the head space app , my day get better earlier and earlier every day . all the horrid side effect have go just tire and some blurry vision and sometimes mild headaches but apart from that all be good and improve all the time . i be go back to work next week , phase in to start with , i have be off 6 weeks , scar but positive that i need structure again and this will help . keep go everyone it will get better , be kind to yourself and get outside and walk it really help . thank to this amaze website i have have great support when i think i be alone , it have really help me and of course you gillian , you have be a big part of my belief that i would get better so thank you so much . still get a way to go i know that and i will have down days but at least i know know that i will get there . matt yeah . how long do these blips usually last ? i felt better last night around 11pm and be able to go back to sleep . this morning as soon as eye open start feel bad again . i have not that feel and over a week and a half . now all of sudden it be back for like 3 days now . i feel like i be go backwards . feel horrid today . i miss how felt last week . can not

not get it . i know you have talk about blips so i be hop that be what this be , my councillor say it be likely due to start back at work and feel very proud and happy with myself the first couple of days and then dip down and expect to feel that high and sence of achievement all the time but i be back to reality now ! i be just try to push on and pray i do not go back the way , that would be

what ? just curious . they put me from cit to 50mg sertraline and i have to up it each week till i get to 200mg , also 15mg mirtazapine . i have a seizure so the psychiatrist drop to 100mg sertraline , it be all to much for me along with the diazipan . three weeks ago i have my mirena coil replace , it have be in for 7 . 5 years so have run out of progesterone , to be honest i ve felt calmer since i have that coil , maybe a lot of my problems have be hormonal , who know but i m wean off the diazipan over the next month then want to get down to the theroptic dose of sertraline which be 50mg and hopefully by the summer i can stop the mirtazapine , will have to see how things go but i have a lot of faith in cbt . glad your keep well matt bless your heart . . you be thru alot . . . wow that be alot of meds . . but happy your do better . . . i be feed up , i have be take citalopram for 6 weeks now . 2 weeks 10mg , 4 weeks 20mg . before take citalopram i start with sickness that wake me up at

doc say my ocd need a higher dose so she move me to 60 mg which i have be on for two weeks ! i can not understand how i do so well those 4 to 6 weeks on the 40 and go backwards badly ! i try to wait

dabilitating depression week 7 just start to feel better be to hell and back one day at a time . i be in 20mg for 2 years then it be up to 40mg this year . it be it that stage i decide after a month to come off it because i felt great . big mistake . 2 months later i decide to go back on the 40mg . omg it be like my body be hit with every emotion go and my bladder be out of control which i be tell it be a side effect etc . any it s be decide to reduce to 20mg . before i know it i d take an overdose and be take to hospital . this be down to go on the 40mg straight away . i be check out by the hospital counsellors . i m now back home and it s 3 weeks since go back on cit and each day appear to be get better although i m still cry in the morning which be to be expect . hi gillian update to say i m in my 4th week back on cit 20mg and i m slowly start to feel better , not perfect . the mornings be still the worst with cry etc . but the good feel be longer and by night time i feel my old self . please for others in the same or similar position stick with the it , it do improve loveyourself hi gillian update to say i m in my 4th week back on cit 20mg and i m slowly start to feel better , not perfect . the mornings be still the worst with cry etc . but the good feel be longer and by night time i feel my old self . please for others in the same or similar position stick with the it , it do improve loveyourself i be about to go on 20mg citalopram which will be my 2nd time on the drug . i be on 10mg for 3 years and stop take them a little over a year ago not on purpose , i guess because i felt fine i just forget to take them and i ve be fine up until recently i can see old habit creep back . anyway i go to dr they prescribe them to me again . i didn t really get side effect the 1st time round apart from heighten anxiety for a month or so . i m so worry this time that i will get lot of side effect and they win t work as well as they do before . i mainly suffer with health anxiety and general anxiety which in turn cause depression . so start any medication make me freak out . please tell me there be light at the end of the tunnel and they will work for me like they do before thank you for your reply . i definitely shouldn t have come off it and i think i will need them forever . however at the moment i m not sure if i will ever feel better again . mornings and even be worst i think that s because i be at work in the day so that occupy my mind . i m snappy when at home because i m tire and fight this anxiety that i don t even know why it be there in the first place . i m struggle with my appetite at the moment , i love food so the fact i can t seem to finish my even meal like i use to be bother me , although i m not sure if the heat have something to do with it hi gillian , how be you ? i ve miss some tablets again i m re start them today and will set an alarm to remind me to take them . back at square one again hi gillian thank you for all your share and everyone else on here i start back on celexa for 2nd time after 2 years off . so this time i start in begin of june this year , have to start low do do to be very sensitive to meds so my first do be 10 mg for 10 days then 15 mg for 8 days after that 20 mg for 4 weeks hop it would work for me again be that i be on that same do 2 years back . but after 4 week i get worse on it , so gp put me up on 30 mg . i have be on this do now for 7 weeks tomorrow and still go though lot of side effect , like anxiety attack very high and for almost all day , hot chest , shake , dry mouth and so on . so today my husband see me like this think i need to go down a bite like 25 mg . he think the 30mg do what it support to do but be to high for me now . do u think its wise to do so , be that in the last few day it have give me very high string anxiety and much more . i do have lorazapam 0 . 5 for anxiety attack but they only help so long . also first time today it wake me up 5 be what it never do before in the 7 weeks on the 30 mg . please give me ur input or someone on here that have go though something similar like me . sorry for this long letter , but scar of not come out on this celexa this time when it help me the first time 2 years ago . sorry forget to inform you never be depress in my life and anxiety be first then the depression come after be sick for over 1 year or longer because dr could not find what be wrong with me . in that time be home lose wait and let my job go the anxiety come and not much longer the depression . so i get this year sick again and in that time of be sick the anxiety come and also depression . i better stop this letter now , sorry for any miss spell and for it be soooo o o long of a letter look forward to any reply thank you babsyboo i totally agree with gillian ! i think you be gp have give you poor advice and move you up far too quickly through the dose . your body have not have time to adjust to one dose before move up again - it do not know where it be . i be go through severe side effect for 6 months , nausea , and horrendous insomnia . personally , i would try and get back to 20mg and stick it out - esp if it

       "      <td>so i have just be to my gp for a check up after be on my citalopram 40mg for 5 weeks now . i tell her that my side effect be start to go now and that even though i have have a little bite of improvement , chat a bite more , less anxious , still feel low but not cry as much i still feel like their be a lot of room for improvement . she tell me that after 4-6 weeks i should notice a difference and say this be a good sign that my tablets be work and they should have reach a peak by now . what i be confuse about be , be this it then ? i ask her if i would keep improve and i do not really get a straight answer so i do not know if things will keep get better as time go on and will i still start to feel better because i feel like i be no where near what i be like before . she do not offer a change just tell me i will need to take them for atleast 6 months-1 year . so will i keep improve for a bite because i really do not feel like i be half way their yet . pointless ask a doctor they know nothing about antidepressants yes , well too early to tell ! these be powerful drug , put it this way i reduce from 10mg to 6mg 11 months ago and only just start to have better days . totally understand . may i ask what make you stay on them for so long if you werent really get benefit from them ? have you ever hear of polydrugging ? its what doctor be good at , basically the first drug i get put on cause a symptom the docs think its real so give you another on top which cause another symptom until the patient doesnt know what be cause what , it never stop unless you end up be rush to hospital with a suspect stroke yes i totally understand that polydrugging after my doctor try to misdiagnose me for have arthritis . and try to give me drug for it . thank god i be aware of all the side effect n meds interactions . other wise i would of probably have all kinds of poop go on in my system . when i tell my doctor that she be wrong she couldnt believe that i say no to her arthritis meds . i bet . after all these decades that the ssris have be on the market you think they would know something . other than oh yoh will be find in two weeks . i guess they do not want to verbally scare their patients . with med drama . take me eight months . i know everyones chemistry be different . and iam still improve after be on them for roughly 3years . most definitely . both . oh my goodness it be and be the best feel ever . yes for 8full months . completely go . that be why i would never come off . can not risk that ant feel terrorize me again . i have be on citalopram a total of 7 months now , i be initially on 10mg , they increase me to 20mg and i stay on that for 5 . 5 months . i find that the 20mg seem much to high for me , it make me numb emotionally , and just felt weird so i reduce to 15mg , and so far and the past week i feel much more like my old self . so it be really a guess game as to the right dose , and how long it take to feel much better . you will have periods of feel better , and then a dip , then feel better , to where the dip happen rarely and the majority of time you feel good . do not get discourage if you have a dip just bare through it and tell yourself its temp and you be still on the path to feel better ! my doctor also tell me 6-8 weeks for full effect , that be so far from true for most people , most of the time . i would say you should start have some good days by then , and they will continue to increase for months , some people have say up to 7-8 months . so just give it time , stick with it . best wish ! i totally understand the adrenaline drama . i have that for 8months . it would start in my stomach and it would end on top of my head the most bizzare feel in the world . yes despair be definitely the correct definition . like omg what be happen why do i feel like this . etc . ah , the good old doctor advice again ...... . it may be that the meds reach their peak by 4-6 weeks i m not a medic so have no idea but that doesn t mean you will feel well by 4-6 weeks . these meds like all ssri s be slow work - it take me 6 months to feel better . no this be not your maximum - you have a long way to go yet . 4-6 weeks be really early . even though you may feel some improvement already , don t be fool , because usually recovery come and go - and that mean the symptoms come back time after time setbacks blips . this be completely normal and be just the way the meds work . so yes - you will keep improve , but as say , don t be too surprise if you start feel ill again . its perfectly normal . just keep go and those setbacks will finally cease to come . don t be in a rush either - let recovery come and go and you ll find over time you ll feel better and better . mwahahahahaha ...... me , celeb ? just an ordinary pleb lol . anxiety be a strange condition to have and its just as strange when recover , as it fox people into think they re not get better . but the meds be work despite how bad you might feel . glad you re feel some relief and yes , it should improve much more over time . let us know how it go . ps ...... . shall i send you my autograph hahaha . . . . there you go i have just see people go through what i do many moon ago . . . think the same , go down the wrong path , feel the same feel . . . . . so just like to lend a hand and pass on what i learn as i recover . yes the anxiety will come and go , and seem for no reason . its actually your reaction to it that count - freak about it , try and run away , try and stop it and it will just cling all the more - but let it be , work with it , take it with you however bad it feel , acknowledge it and do not start analyse it then it will lose its power and ease off . its not easy , but thats the way forward . also do not overdo things - when you have get anxiety it mean your body have reach its overload with stress and your body be tire , so as you recover take things easy , slow yourself down and be gentle on yourself . yes your mindset will change a lot - when you be have good time your body will feel calm and your thoughts light and lift - then when anxiety hit you it seem all you have felt yesterday have go out the window today as you feel frighten , think negative thoughts and can not see a way forward . its just anxiety that bring these effect with it - so an anxious body an anxious mind and a calm body a calm mind . one more thing - do not hope tomorrow be a good day , because if it be not then you will feel even more disappoint and frustrate . instead accept whatever come and just know that the anxiety will pass . . . . . maybe tomorrow , maybe next week or the week after . let it come and go as it please . anxiety be always worse in the mornings - apparently its to do with cortisol be at its highest first thing when wake . bad mornings and calmer even be exactly how recovery work for me - by the even i d feel a little calmer , and over time i begin to look forward to my even as they get better . those good feel gradually creep into more into my day so i d start feel more at ease earlier and earlier - and around 6 months i finally start wake with no anxiety . throughout that time i still have blips where i felt rubbish all day , but those days pass . yes it be tire - its always 3 step forward and 2 step back ... all the way . you will get better - just let recovery come to you - it will . hi potatoghost just be read your initial post and be wonder whether your doctor start you on 40mg or whether you have increase to 40mg . it seem such a high dose if that be what you have start on . in either case it may be worth discuss with your doctor whether a dose adjustment may suit you better . have you ask the doctor for a short term benzo ? ? i call it impend doom , at one point i be terrify of everything , scar to snap a bar of dark chocolate seriously i have be like that many months , it do ease hi high blood pressure meds be good for folks who have speak to an audience anxiety or who have heart palpitations . but too add a high blood pressure med to mental issue be ludicrous . how ling where you on mirt . ? totally agree with you . honestly i can still only watch certain things as some trigger me , how long be you on mirtazapine for ? yes i agree , i have come off mirt 3 time the first 2 be easy the last time be hell it last only 4 months , also from what i have read on here some people cit withdrawal sound less severe than others i have read elsewhere i literally have 100s of symptoms , just show how everyone be different you have to remember every time you fiddle with the dose be like start the process all over again for most folks . do not be afraid to take your benzo your doctor prescribe . why suffer ? i have be in withdrawal in one form or another fir nearly 2 years , add meds and change dose will mess with your cns so be careful i know for a fact the benzo will not make you depress . i would be more worry about change meds or increase meds . hi potatoghost i have a mirtazapine withdrawal support group on facebook bingo i tell you one thing without that benzo i would of end in a mental institution . at first they wouldnt give it to me after five months of suffer they finally approve my benzo . only use it for one year . the lowest dose . i just stop take it one day no withdrawl no drama for me . not anymore docs here in the uk rarely give them out as theyre so addictive even short term , i have 42 untouched diazepam i wont take them as take them for 5 days and have terrible withdrawals for months also they make you feel down when theyre wear off , of course everyone be different but personally its a no from me ! also cns be your central nervous system well i be dam . then you should already know the benzo do not give depression . bite the bullet and do not suffer . thank goodness i do not have an addictive personality . i can not even drink a glass of wine . lol if i drink i want to sleep . lol</td>\n",

gillian . i have 2 book recommend by my therapist . mind over mood and the 5 second rule . basically we can not allow our feel , our emotions dictate our action . we may not feel like get out of bed , we may not feel like go for a walk or eat healthy but we need count down in our head 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 and when we hit 1 get up and do what we need to do . it be hard . you will not like it at first but overtime it work . you retrain your brain by your action . you can not think your way out of anxiety . you have to take action . fake it till you become it . hi just wonder how you get g on , i be have negativethoughts too , only on 10mg it be good to hear positive stuff . thank mary oh my yes ! . . . be not that ever the truth , mary ! ! i be the same start to feel better at week 6 and now on

i be on 15mg and di want to go to just 10 but just see that 29 be the thereputic dose so maybe stay where i be for now life be good once you get through the tunnel to the other side hi shane it be good to hear a positive story . i be on citalopram for years and be mainly fine , so i reduce them due to hunger issue . about a month ago i crash badly , i have be back on them for a few weeks just over 2 weeks at 20mg . i felt better last week , back at work , almost normal . feel worse again this week , depress and feel like part of my personality be miss i have be on 10mg for 3 wks now and wonder when i will start to feel myself again . yes i saw that . it be just dissapointing as i begin to feel ok last week but feel rubbish again , be cry last night . but i do have a stressful day on

, hi elliot thank so much for your encourage word . it be so hard to remember when you be feel bad . at each stage of improvement i feel like this be go to be it forever and i never learn but i need

at night , which be what i do the last time i be on it . it be make me very sleepy when i first start and i do not have any problems sleep on it . hi gillian i be out on 10mg for 2 wks but i be give 20on monday but scar to take it . i speak to doctor today and she say go up to 20 tomoro because it be more therapeutic . up till now but say he felt awful last night have morbid thoughts , panicky . . and anxiety worse , do not know wether to wring drs tomorrow or what . . tell him to hang in in there and take one day at a time - worst of the side effect be usually out of the way around 2 weeks but the full benefit of citalopram can vary with different people which be usually measure in months . good luck but start get low , so she put him on citalapran 20mg i be so worry about him hes lose 2 stone , get a feel in be stomach can not eat , never be poorly in his life , never have a day off work . . he be put hi , like gillian days you will get lot of advice , personal stories and lot of support on this forums . try not to dwell on things and look forward to better time ahead . personally i lose 2 . 5 stone last year and everyone on here will tell you that they have be through hell to get to the other side but good time lay ahead . try and get him to manage healthy food , meditation and mindfulness really help me too . hi gillian you want me to repost this post under here about reason why meds take so long and why you feel rubbish be warn folks . . . . . . its a l-o-n-g post hi everyone , here s something i find online which you may find intersting . its about why you feel so rubbish when take these meds , why your mood be up and down , why it take so long and the process it all go through . sorry its a long post . when start an ssri or increase it be dose often make people feel really rubbish , which can cause a great deal of stress as you begin to wonder whats happen , why be their illness get worse , be these meds work etc . somone recently post a great post explain what these meds do in our brain , and i d like to add further to this . so , as already post ... . . the brain be basically a big dense bundle of nerve which carry electrical signal around our brain and body . the nerve cells don t touch each other , leave a small gap between each cell , call a synapse . so how do signal get from one nerve to another ? neurotransmitters be chemicals release by nerve cells that tell a neighbour nerve cell to pass the signal along . a bite like pass the parcel . serotonin be one such neurotransmitter . so when an electrical signal reach the end of a nerve cell that deal with serotonin , that cell release serotonin into the gap synapse , which then cross the gap and interact with the nearby nerve cell and tell it to pass the signal along . once the serotonin have do it be job , the serotonin be then reabsorb from the gap so that no more signal be pass until the next one come down the nerve . ssris , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors interfere with this reabsorbtion process and thus it stay in the gap longer , which equate to more serotonin and more signal . so further on from there ... . . why do you feel so rubbish ? so , along with the release of serotonin , and reabsorb it , nerve cells also have part that detect an increase in serotonin level and tell the nerve cell to stop produce anymore serotonin until the level drop . these be call autoreceptors , which be the reason you feel like so rubbish . so the ssri will increase the amount of serotonin that s gather in the synapses between nerve cells , but unfortunately the autoreceptors of the nerve cell pick up on this increase and tell the nerve cell to stop produce serotonin . the result of this be that when you first start take an ssri your serotonin level drop . how do they go up again ? eventually with continuous use of the ssri medication , the autoreceptors become desensitise , that be to say they have continually tell the nerve cell to stop produce serotonin but yet serotonin be still there . in short they simply give up . they stop tell the nerve cell to stop produce serotonin and your serotonin level start to increase . this desensitisation take time , it do not happen over night and it will not even begin to happen until the ssri level have stabilise . this be why you feel so rubbish , and be why your mood drop and your anxiety increase also fuelledd by the fear of not know whats go on . your mood will be up and down as the seronotin continue to try to stablise . so , to summarise : ssris cause your serotonin level to drop when you first start take them . your serotonin level will not rise until the autoreceptors in your brain have stop work become desensitise , all of which take lot and lot of time . everyone be different , so for some it can be many weeks and other months . i hope this help some people to understand what these meds be do and why you do not get instant result , compare to other meds that work in different ways which be the reason they can have a more immediate effect benzos for example . how be you now ? it could be weeks or months till he feel better , he frighten he want be ever be able to go back to work hes only be on them 4 days , l feel sorry for him hes such a strong man hi merry christmas . tell your husband to give it time and allow the meds to do there job . i know things look bleak and there seem no end in sight button there be . i have be to work today . after 12 weeks of these meds . even at 10week i think i would never feel better . hello i have be in citropalm for 3 weeks and be feel a bite better last week than i do this week . im on 10 mg but go up to 20 tomoro i hop to start feel myself very soon . what be your husband on what mg . i have never have anything like this before either and i be off work 3 wks now . stop take them , his anxiety be worse dry mouth , only be hi merry christmas , i be on them 7 years and come of them worst thing i do . how long be you off of the meds before reinstate ? hope you see this as i be afraid to go back on after be off for 8 months . long story short , they work for me for years then stop work , doc up the dose and they work again , and then stop work , so i go cold turkey . it be be hell . want to reinstate but have read it can make it all worse . your story make me feel better about go back on them . just wonder about your reinstatement dose and how long between not take and reinstate . thank so much . hi there ! well i be only off them very briefly in 2000 . then go straight back on the 20mgs . so i have be on 20mgs for 17 years and they have keep me go . so 4 weeks ago i have to have hem up to 40mgs due to move house , job etc and it kick everything off . not be like this for 17 years ! ! i be still quite anxious and get up in the morning be a struggle . . but hopefully the next couple of weeks they will start to work . i hate this feel so much as i feel like it be such an effort to just get through the day . keep in touch and let me know how you get on . hi nicola99452 may i ask what the name of the antihistamine be by wednesday dry mouth and edgie thursday and friday suicidal thoughts wrang drs say stay on them but if to bad come off them , saturday fine my old husband back till dinner time go right down , we end up at crisis health center , they speak for two hours to him dr explain about citalopran , sunday morning he wake up frighten to death , couldnt see a way out of this , cry sweat shake suicidal , get up didnt take cit till dinner felt bad this morning but not as bad as yesterday hi merry christmas sorry to hear things have be really rough for you both . your husband really need to take the citalopram at the same time every day . it be really important to keep the level steady in his system rather than take it erratically . have he get some diazepam to help with the anxiety panic . it be a life saver for me . gerry hi merry christmas . i be sorry to hear he be have such a rough time , it take somebody to be very brave to admit that they be have suicidal thoughts but i can not stress the importance enough of take your citalopram at the same time everyday . you need to be really strict with this , he be only make it harder for himself . what you should both focus on be that infact he have a good day on saturday , and try not to get dishearten that it only last a small amount of time , those days will get easier . by day 7 i be ready to throw in the towel , but now i be on day 16 and extremely glad i do not . your husband need to talk to somebody regard the think s hes have to ensure he understand what be happen . i doubt that your husband be actually suicidal , i certainly know i have suicidal thoughts during the worst part of citalopram but when your at that level of anxious its very easy to confuse the fear of become suicidal not be able to cope with that of be suicidal . this will get better , i be look forward to hear about his recovery in the come weeks . i understand that as a man , my natural reaction be to help myself get better . i be absolutely work motivate and terrible when i be off for anything , be anxiety only make that worse due to the nature of the illness . i want your husband to know that i have be through what he be experience , he might not believe me but what he be experience be most definetly temporary , and you can 100 blame the citalopram for it because it be scientifically prove that these drug make you feel worse before they make you feel better . can i suggest that you look into a book call dare , its available on amazon prime and i find it really help me understand and cope with the first few weeks , and it be also extremely therapeutic to read about the techniques you can use to help yourself recover . your husband most likely will be struggle to keep busy at the moment , so the bad days probably feel like they be go to last forever . i think its really important that you continue to do gentle activities when in your worst state , this will not be easy but i utilise the mentalityy well i feel so bad so this really can not make me feel any worse so why the hell not . gentle walk , watch a funny tv show , visit close family and friends who can offer support , draw . please take the tablet at the same time everyday , i do not sleep well with them at the start so i take them in the morning with breakfast . have a look at mind mental health charity to see if they can support your husband in the early days of this medication . progress be go to be slow , and there be go to be setbacks but he need to keep remind himself that this be a temporary problem cause by his body s inability to calibrate to the drug any quicker . when i felt awful last week , i tell myself this statement probably over 500 time a day just to put things into perspective . all the best . ing word , he have felt abit better since yesterday afternoon , bite frighten this morning again but it pass , finger cross the worse might be over , see drs tomorrow say hes felt gillian , thank your for post your success story , it make me feel a lot better read your post and all the comment . i be on celexa for the 3rd time . be on it a few years ago then think i do not need it anymore . anxiety come back about a year ago , try celexa again but stop after 6 weeks bc i do not feel a difference . then try 3 other meds but none work so now i be try celexa again . you be right , i think i will wait a bite longer . i get a new gp and i do not think she really know what she be do . when she prescribe it she tell me to start with 10mg and increase 10mg each week until i start feel better or get to 40mg . which i know be way too fast because i have go through this before . my last doctor be great but he move to a different location . morning , have terrible night , suicidal thoughts of harm hiself , he wasnt so depress before he start them . just hope he can i have be on 20 mg for 7 weeks . have not have much of a change . do most people take 20 mg or 40mg . how to determine if you need to up the dose or do an add on . i be not feel too good this week , low and tearful . the issue i have be deal with be that i be 33 and never have a boyfriend , i feel like a freak and that it will never happen . it be probably the hi nicola , i be feel really stange now . i have periods of feel ok last week but i feel worse this week . i think cos i be think about the relationship thing again . i do not feel like myself , a bite tearful again . i get this weird cold feel behind the front of my shoulder and in my chest and feel fearful . sorry to go on and on . hi nicola , just read your post and it sound like you be in a bad place at the moment , but remember it be just a moment in your life . it will not be forever . things change from one day to the next and one minute you can be single and a couple of years down the line in a relationship with kid , believe me that be what it be like for my sister . you look so pretty on your profile picture you should surely have no difficulty find a boyfriend - it must just be a confidence thing . thank you . i do not understand why it have not happen yet , i have have so much rejection . but i think i give off the wrong vibes . i do not know how to change it . i feel quite tearful at the moment . i be at work but i will probably go home and cry . hi nicola sorry to butt in on your conversation with everyone , but want to say that my son have a breakdown just over 2 years ago because he be not good at socialise and have a bad relationship which make him ill . he start meds too , be very ill and could not work for 4 months - his doctor say to step outside his comfort zone a little . i get him interest in music african drum and guitar . . . not together mind and slowly he felt able to go to the group alone . he also join badminton and slowly he begin to heal . it take him 9 months to recover and be now back to normal . go out to social group he meet a lovely girl and they be still together and he still continue to play music . he will never be a social butterfly , as still struggle in some company , but he be go out and next week they be off to italy for a holiday . join something will find friends first . . . . . . and who know what will follow . i work with my husband for 2 years before we get together . . . . . again we be friends first . sometimes that special person be right under your nose and you do not realise it i have try things like that but nothing yet . i just feel so low and cry again , i can not see any hope or point . i be see the dr on friday again but i be scar she will up my dose and the hunger problems i have before will come back . you be not in the right place at the moment . you need to look after yourself first . . . . . join some group maybe something completely different to what you would ever think of do should be for yourself first . this will help you to heal too . the meds will kick in and you will feel in a much better place . that person will come along some day . many years ago when i be recover i start dance class . what a way to build confidence ! ! 16 years later i be now a dance teacher and i love watch how new students grow with confidence - all shape and size my best dancer be over 20 stone . . . . . . such an amaze woman . they do something for themselves and become absorb in the music and movement . i have one shy student in her 30 s who be be internet date , still look for the one , but say dance have make her feel different about herself recovery on these meds be slow - it often get worse before it get better , so i be not surprise you will feel at an all time low at the moment . it really do get better . your doctor can suggest you increase your dose , but at the end of the day its your body and completely your choice . they can only advise . thank for share how i will your son be but most of all his success story that be great hi nicola before i start citalopram my confidence and self esteem have be shatter with be bully by 2 girls where i work i be in a right mess . i have be single for 3 years but once the meds get into my system everything else start to get better and i make still single but i know i will meet someone one day and so will you but like people have say you need to get yourself better first and it will all fall into place i be better for age and it do not fall in to place . so i be not that confident it will . i now you be try to help but when it be never happen for you you can not imagine it ever will . unfortunately after over 2 months i be not feel better and just do not want to get out of bed . do not care about anything . dr have change my meds which i start in a few days . i be quite scar to be honest . hey nicola , oh nicola , i be sorry . when i restart these meds it take much , much longer than the first time , and probably be about 7-8 months until they kick in and i have a completely different experience 2nd time . i really hope the transition be as smooth as can be . post back here when you be ready - everyone be here for you . yeah i do not think i can do 7-8 months feel like this . at the intensity you be feel the symptoms , i do not blame you . sorry to post on such a old post but would love your thoughts . . . i have take citalopram 2 time before with amaze result after a rough initial month . come off it late last year honestly believe i do not need to be on it . anyway late feb be strike back down , doctor tell me to go back on them and say i can stay on them this time . i start on 20mg and have a rough couple of weeks , then start to feel much better , even remember think wow they have never work this quickly before , then stupidly i up the dose to 40mg as i have be on that before , side effect come crash back , but then after 2 weeks again i begin to feel better . . . until i saw a doctor who i ask for reassurance because even though i be feel better i want reassurance it would work as well as it have do previously , she do not give me that reassurance and tell me that sometimes your hormones can change . . . since then i come crash back down . . . 3 and a bite weeks ago i decide to give up on it and lower my dose to 20mg to start weening but now i be in 2 mind whether to stick or move on . i want to stick as work amaze in the past and do not want to put myself through the whole start again with another drug . . . could it not be work as well this time simply because i have mess with the dose too much and not allow it to settle ? or would you think it be simply not work this time ? all in all i have be take it 11 weeks , break down as 2 on 20mg then 5 weeks and a couple of days on 40mg and now 4 weeks on 20mg . . . i think i be better than i be but everyday be still a struggle . . . not sure why it either be not work or be take longer to work this time ? thank you hi i be on lustral for 15 years andrea have to

think i still do get more tire now i be on citalopram i ve be take them 4 mnths now but i can push through it now , it be not so debilitate . my doctor advise that i take my tablet before bed so i be not as tire in the day but i have sleep problems so do not want to mess with that as i be ok take it in the morning . hi everyone . im so glad i find this discussion . i have be on a therapeutic dose of 20mgs of citalopram for the last 18 years after have the most horrendous p n depression . i do come off them for a short time but end up relapse when my dad pass away . anyway , i have just have quite a few major change in my life and start with panic attack , anxiety , insomnia , depression and no appetite at all . so i be today on week 4 of 40mgs of citalopram and still do not feel as though i be there yet . im still struggle to eat , however i can sleep which be an improvement . the worst time for me be first thing in a morning . i struggle to get out of the bed and do feel quite nauseous and tire till late afternoon . as i be write this i feel okay . i be nowhere near as bad as i be with the p n depression as back then i could not even look at my face in the mirror as it be not my face . have anyone else experience depersonalisation and the feel that they be not themselves . this for me be the worst bite of depression . thank gilliam it do take a while do not it . so happy you be much better and thank for the positive story hi everyone , i have be on and off of celexa for years . the first time i take it i be 21 and stay on until i be 24 but gain about forty pound . i be sure it be not just the medicine but it definitely increase my appetite . i go on it again for a short period in 2006 to deal with some situational anxiety but once i switch job my doc pull me off of it because she felt it be all job relate . so in 2012 i be go through a rough patch . . . have an occular migraine , go through a long period of date the wrong guy , and be deal with the fear of lose my grandmother who be very ill . i start at 10 mg for a week and then move to 20 mg . it take about 3 to 4 weeks to start to feel better but a lot of my situations start to work themselves out meet a new boyfriend , figure out what my migraine be , etc . i drop to 10 mg in 2014 because i be concern about the weight gain all the best ! shane hi shane . i too be exactly the same as you . just hang on in there get through each day . friends keep ask , you get any plan for this week i say , i be just gon na try and get through it to which they say sorry . it be difficult for some to understand be not it . i be week 5 now . although last time which be a long time ago be around the 8 9 week mark when i saw some good days . so keep go shane . we have to . it be the only way to beat it and come out the other side stronger than ever x x you be certainly correct we just need to keep on fight thru the tough days to get to the better days ahead . yes we do . we will get there ! just try and keep positive too and say nice things to yourself . apparently it get into the subconscious and help with heal . keep in touch hi shane hi sarah , not happy that you be have these side effect but glad that it be not only me . . . if that make any sense ! i saw my doctor today and she confirm what gillian and katecogs often say . it get better with time and just stay the course because gradually we will see improvements . it be too soon to consider a different ssri or to up the dose . doc suggest at review at 12 weeks to see where things be at . i have go this far so i can tough it out for 3 more weeks . bloody hard some days though ! hang in ! shane shane hi shane , what do you think about this i have take citalopram 2 time before with amaze result after a rough initial month .

there . shane i be hop 12 weeks will be a milestone for better days to kick in . shane hi shane . shane hi thank you for this post it give me hope . i be on week 3 and the mornings be just horrible , can not wait to feel better . this positive post help me no end thank ! hi gillian i be nearly at week 3 , feel so awful but read these post be keep me go . just want to feel free from this anxiety and depression but i know i will just get to wait and let the ctl take effect . thank hi gillian thank again . i be new to this site so just get use to find any reply ! matt hi i have be on cit for 4 months and the first few weeks be the worst but i be nearly back to my old self . tell him to hang in there . x hi shane . wow 14 weeks ? ? and your still on 20mg . have your gp not suggest you increase to 40mgs ? i find 20mgs do not work for me , only 40mgs . once i be totally better for over 6 months he then reduce it to 20mgs . which i be on for years . i do not know if you remember me say that my citalopram have stop work so i have be out onto duloxetine . well i do 2 weeks on 30mgs and as i be still anxious and low mood he increase it to 60mgs . i have do 19 days on the 60mgs and what a difference . no anxiety and sleep and eat well . and my mood have greatly improve . i be up and out and about now and go back to work in 2 weeks . i definatley think 40mgs would be better . be you take anything else to help with the anxiety ? i have diazepam for a short while which help x x you will get there . be you manage to get out and about ? hi angie , i work and have not take any time off thru out this ordeal . however it have be difficult . . . actually pretty much hell . my doc do suggest an increase or even try a different ssri but i be so afraid of start all over with side effect with no guarantee that something new or an increase will make a difference . it be bearable but unpleasant now . i be just hop that an improvement be come soon . interest that for some they get relief at 8 weeks or so while for others it take months . unfortunately i fall in the later group thank for your note i appreciate any comment , suggestions this forum have be a godsend on those horrible days ! shane yes you have a positive attitude so you will get there but it be s long road but so worth it to feel better . its my first time on medication like this 2 . hi shane , i be in a similair situation to you . i have be on 20 mg citalopram for 6 mnths now and although things be so much better and i have spell when i feel back to my old self i be not totally back to normal all the time and still feel very low at time . i have be consider up my dose to 30 mg but also scar about the side-effects come back , even if if be for a couple of weeks , it be hard to deal with when you have to get on with your life . i be manage now so do not want to rock the boat . maybe if you have some time book off work you could up to 30 mg , that be what i be plan in the next few couple of weeks but whether i will or not i do not know . have you be up and down or just down all the time ? also have you improve since before you start take them ? it be hard have to wait so long for result but these things do take time and i think the worse you be before take the medication and the longer you be ill the longer it take to get better . hi i be sorry it be a typo . only twice . i want to give 15 a fair shoot . base on what i have read here and other article although dose be important it seem give time be vital . until the brain decide to desensitize itself from extra serotonin level free flow and tell the neuron cells to go ahead fire away more we will continue to feel off . i be on week 4 on the med 10mg and 4th day on 15 . have a really good day yesterday hop for more of those mornings be the absolute worst . thank you all for the encouragement start my 5th week today . experience 4 consecutive days of feel really good at the end of week 4 into the weekend where we be in vacation as a family . hi . so i do not know whether to laugh at this or be scar . today i arrive home from our 5 day vacation , on my drive home the palpitations start . as i get home much of the old anxiety thoughts and feel i leave behind slowly start to creep up . as i saw my inlaws who live with us and my father in law recently sick with cancer which trigger this anxiety spell 2 months ago yes i be actually in low dose of metaprolol beta blocker . if i take too much it make my anxiety worse . be it normal to be freakin out 5 weeks into medicine ? i have 4 really good days as i say . now i have a meet for this morning and i could not sleep and i be feel super panicky this morning like i do not want to face the people at work . also do the clock start all over again each time you go up strength ? in other word i be 5 weeks total into the drug but only about a week and a half on the 15mg s . do it take another 4 to 6 weeks on the new strength ? i though because i have a month build up of the 10mg and because i felt so good 2 days after go up to 15 that i would just get better faster . but now i be wonder if it take more time . the nurse do say i should be in another 4 weeks when they increase it . you do not get better faster because of dosage increase and yes you be likely to go through renew side effect . my doctor have to me to do dosage increase slowly over a period of time so that they be not as much of a shock to my system and the effect be not as abrupt but yes i do still get them to some degree . oh ok . i just need to give the 15 more weeks then . even if i do end up on 20 . i be so sensitive to this stuff . today have be really rough . i hope there be truly light at end of tunnel that make this sacrifice worth it . sometimes i think of just quit and try to face it on my own again . but then i will feel good and think oh maybe there be hope for me yet . i know and i appreciate your encouragement . but i be feel so bad right now on the 15 . side effect worse and last longer i just do not see how i can go to 20 now . i feel like side effect be so much worse at the 15 . i can not get any relief for the last 48 hrs . i do not experience that on 10 . i at least have good even or afternoons . anyone go to 15 and feel it be too much then go back to 10mg ? how do that work out ? i feel like 2 weeks into 15 this make me worse not better . any thoughts greatly appreciate . hi gillian it be great that you post motivational stuff and i love read what you do to stuart the day and far far you have come , it give me hope ! 5th week on cut 20mg , have a couple of good days , today not so much but still load better than i be . tomorrow morning i be go to try and get up when i wake even if it be early as it have be and do things to keep my brain occupy and hopefully start the day better , i be sure it will . start the councilloring on wednesday so hopefully that will help too , anxiety and stupid thoughts in my head be still exhaust but have be try meditation and read up on except the thoughts and then think of something else , it take practice but i be happy to keep try . still positive that i will get me back soon and count the weeks lol . thank again for your post and support matt hi gillian i have just download them and will give them a go . thank again matt hi gillian and all so at the moment i be get myself ready to go food shop , a shop with people in and decisions to make lol , feel anxious and sweaty , so silly be not it , it be just a shop ! get up straight away this morning have a cup of tea then go for a walk , determine to stay out of my bed today , sick of the sight of it to be honest just about 5 and a half weeks into 20mg of cit , obviously better than i be o know i be but still struggle but know by read all the post on here that it will keep get better just keep tell myself i have make progress . keep post positive things people , it help so much . matt hi gillian thank you again , it be so reassure to hear your post . i go shop with my husband , it be not to bad , when we get home i cry for about 20 minutes , maybe it be the tension ? i be at five and a half weeks now on 20mg and do know i be improve but do you think at this stage i should be back to normal ? it be such a terrible thing anxiety , it be get easier but still have a head full of nonsense and churn tummy , not as bad though , should all that be go now at this stage ? thank again for your support and encouragement , i feel so needy it be a bite pathetic at my age , i be 51 , it be like a want someone to tell me it will be ok even though i know i be better than i be , silly really matt hello . feel much better on the cit 10mg . i be curious anyone else get pvcs palpitations hello . still feel better but notice a few blips this weekend . sit afternoon felt side effect from the medicine which i have not felt at all in days . and this mon morning wake up feel nervous and anxious think of all things i have to do feel overwhelm and some intrusive thoughts . have not felt any of that for a long time . i do have a lot go at home with a bedroom remodel and busy at work but when i feel good none of that tend to matter . be this normal ? this start my 3rd week on the 10 consistently after come off 15 . total of 7 weeks on the med . thank . but what i feel today be the side effect from the drug . not high anxiety which be what i be take it for , if i go up the side effect on get worse . i be great all week long . the only change be take a different pill at 10mg feel side effect in the 2nd day so i go back to cut the 20mg in half since i know that pill work for me and today on day 2 back on original i feel my worse . i guess i can not change at all once i be in a groove . i know not all pills be the same . i be hop it do not take me too many days to feel back on track like i have be for a while . that be true . i guess since this all start back in june i feel as though i have be on this for 2 months already not 3 weeks . i be not think that after be on 15 for week i be start all over again at 10 . dr do say be patient and give another 4 weeks but that it should not take that long start feel better . and really it have not . felt great last week and good the week before . i guess i think i be in the clear . hibgillian and all i have not post for a few days as i want my post to be positive and it be ! i be now in week 7 of 20mg and life have start to get good again as you all know the first few weeks be really tough , anxiety and cit side effect , felt like give up so many time and felt i would never make

, it be all to much for me along with the diazipan . three weeks ago i have my mirena coil replace , it have be in for 7 . 5 years so have run out of progesterone , to be honest i ve felt calmer since i have that coil , maybe a lot of my problems have be hormonal , who know but i m wean off the diazipan over the next month then want to get down to the theroptic dose of sertraline which be 50mg and hopefully by the summer i can stop the mirtazapine , will have to see how things go but i have a lot of faith in cbt . glad your keep well matt bless your heart . . you be thru alot . . . wow that be

the it , it do improve loveyourself i be about to go on 20mg citalopram which will be my 2nd time on the drug . i be on 10mg for 3 years and stop take them a little over a year ago not on purpose , i guess because i felt fine i just forget to take them and i ve be fine up until recently i can see old habit creep back . anyway i go to dr they prescribe them to me again . i didn t really get side effect the 1st time round apart from heighten anxiety for a month or so . i m so worry this time that i will get lot of side effect and they win t work as well as they do before . i mainly suffer with health anxiety and general anxiety which in turn cause depression . so start any medication make me freak out . please tell me there be light at the end of the tunnel and they will work for me like they do before thank you for your reply . i definitely shouldn t have come off it and i think i will need them forever . however at the moment i m not sure if i will ever feel better again . mornings and even be worst i think that s because i be at work in the day so that occupy my mind . i m snappy when at home because i m tire and fight this anxiety that i don t even know why it be there in the first place . i m struggle with my appetite at the moment , i love food so the fact i can t seem to finish my even meal like i use to be bother me , although i m not sure if the heat have something to do with it hi gillian , how be you ? i ve miss some tablets again i m re start them today and will set an alarm to remind me to take them . back at square one again hi gillian thank you for all your share and everyone else on here i start back on celexa for 2nd time after 2 years off . so this time i start in begin of june this year , have to start low do do to be very sensitive to meds so my first do be 10 mg for 10 days then 15 mg for 8 days after that 20 mg for 4 weeks hop it would work for me again be that i be on that same do 2 years back . but after 4 week i get worse on it , so gp put me up on 30 mg . i have be on this do now for 7 weeks tomorrow and still go though lot of side effect , like anxiety attack very high and for almost all day , hot chest , shake , dry mouth and so on . so today my husband see me like this think i need to go down a bite like 25 mg . he think the 30mg do what it support to do but be to high for me now . do u think its wise to do so , be that in the last few day it have give me very high string anxiety and much more . i do have lorazapam 0 . 5 for anxiety attack but they only help so long . also first time today it wake me up 5 be what it never do before in the 7 weeks on the 30 mg . please give me ur input or someone on here that have go though something similar like me . sorry for this long letter , but scar of not come out on this celexa this time when it help me the first time 2 years ago . sorry forget to inform you never be depress in my life and anxiety be first then the depression come after be sick for over 1 year or longer because dr could not find what be wrong with me . in that time be home lose wait and let my job go the anxiety come and not much longer the depression . so i get this year sick again and in that time of be sick the anxiety come and also depression . i better stop this letter now , sorry for any miss spell and for it be soooo o o long of a letter look forward to any reply thank you

       "2  i be in the e . r . yesterday for bad palpitations but and all of my test come back good so they send me home but i have be have this sensation of my body be fill with icy hot or hot water be pour all over and then go icy cold . my body be physically cold to the touch too but i feel hot on the inside if that make any sense . i have be have this for a few days now and be wonder if it could be a withdrawl symptom from citalopram , which i only take for like 4 days and have be off for about the same amount of time now . i have be diagnose with anxiety for years now and have never experience this symptom and it be quite scary and concern . i be try to breathe through it in hop that it will subside but it seem to come and go at random and out of seemingly nowhere which always catch me off guard . i be currently not take any other meds except for hydrochlorothiazide 25mg for high blood pressure which i have be take quite some time and never experience this symptom from . i feel like i be on the verge of a nervous breakdown because i have be have all my other anxiety symptoms for months now and that be why my doctor start the citalopram in the first place , which i stop because it only intensify my symptoms . anyone else experience this icy hot sensation ? ? ? hi rachel i have the same for about 10 days 8 weeks into take 20mg citalopram a day . awful feel . . . . it could be because you start and stop or it could be just another symptom of anxiety . i hope you feel better soon

       "3  i have be om citalopram for three weeks now for anxiety . first 10mg for a week and a half and then 20mg for a week and a half . after go to 20mg i start to feel better , not cure of course but calmer . over the weekend i felt almost normal , more in control than before . but today i be terrible again . i never suffer with panic attack but today i have felt like a panic attack be just about to come on . i get almost intense wave of what i can only describe as fear . i be also on my monthly cycle at the moment . do this sound like side effect , even after start to improve ? i be try very hard to be patient as i know recover be slow . . . thank as always for all the support i have be on cit for almost seven weeks . four days on 10mg , five weeks on 20mg , and just up to 30mg five days ago . i do what you do . i improve greatly on the 20mg , feel almost back to myself , then the day i start my cycle , i crash . all of my anxiety hang on you be have a blip on top of your monthly . best regard this be my first cycle since be on the meds . well , i have a cycle as i start the meds so didnt pay attention as i be feel awful from the side effect . most people seem to have blips right before their cycle . if mine be relate , it didnt happen until the day the period actually start . i do have someone respond to me in another thread that say she get blips for 3-4 days before her cycle , so i would say hormones arent help us . lois , i wish i have find this forum before up my dose to 30mg . i think i would have give 20 more time to work . now that i have up to 30 , do you have an opinion on stay with it or go back down ? i have be on it for five days . i fear go back and forth may cause even more probelms thoughts ? lois , how long be you on the 20 before you go back to 10 ? do you have to deal with side effect all over again when you go back down ? hi marketta it may be worth ask doctor for some 10 mg propranolol beta blocker which do help dampen the panic feel a bite as long as you do not have any medical problems that prevent take this . doctor seem quite happy prescribe this instead of diazepam . hi marketta , i be not surprise you be get side effect as you be not give 1 dose enough time to work . you need to be on 1 dose for 8 10 weeks for the medication to work in your system before change your dosage . i be on 20 for one week . but my severe headache so how many days have you be on the 20mg only ? i have be keep a journal and it look like i stop have the morning anxiety maybe we can touch base in a week and we will both be feel some improvement ! feel free to private message me . weve get this ! im just finish my monthly and wonder if it be relate , bc this happen last month , but it seem worse today , and this be the last day of the monthly . im sorry youre still feel bad , too ! im really start to question be on them . absolutely . i have be keep a journal from day one . it have be veey helpful ! hey marketta ! hope you feel better . i start celexa 20 mg since feb 13 . its be about 10 weeks . i have be feel anxiety and get side effect still . i still have panicky feel daily with bad muscular tension . i go to a store today and felt very anxious and have some as i type this . mornings be tough too to get go with all this . i have be get down about this lately as well . my doc want to up the dose to 30 mg but im tear on that as people say not to do it . im five weeks in on the up dose of 30mg . im still not sure increase be a wise choice , but be go to try and stick with it for 12 weeks and reassess . what help me when im have the bad hello lois ! i be go down on 20 mg celexa to 10 mg and think of go off it . i be on 10 for a few days and feel unwell still . i get intrusive thoughts as well . i be on celexa 20 mg for a lmost 13 weeks with side effect from a to z which i couldnt function on . i also get muscle pain and jaw pain with this med . i be have a hard time do things daily . i lay around a lot which i hate . i try to get out from time to time but struggle . my therapist think im get worse depression perhaps if your doctor prescribe a benzo it would be much easier for you to cope with the side effect . hey lois ! arent benzos tough to take everyday ? they be hard to come off of and addictive properties . i struggle everyday to function from mornings be terrible until even . i guess i need something to function . hey lois i go down to 10 mg from 20 mg . im kinda get tire of this med and feel this way . i be think of get off this stuff . be that a decent dose ? how do you know celexa start work when on benzos ? the doc also mention something about cymbalta . thank !

       "4  so i have just be to my gp for a check up after be on my citalopram 40mg for 5 weeks now . i tell her that my side effect be start to go now and that even though i have have a little bite of improvement , chat a bite more , less anxious , still feel low but not cry as much i still feel like their be a lot of room for improvement . she tell me that after 4-6 weeks i should notice a difference and say this be a good sign that my tablets be work and they should have reach a peak by now . what i be confuse about be , be this it then ? i ask her if i would keep improve and i do not really get a straight answer so i do not know if things will keep get better as time go on and will i still start to feel better because i feel like i be no where near what i be like before . she do not offer a change just tell me i will need to take them for atleast 6 months-1 year . so will i keep improve for a bite because i really do not feel like i be half way their yet . pointless ask a doctor they know nothing about antidepressants yes , well too early to tell ! these be powerful drug , put it this way i reduce from 10mg to 6mg 11 months ago and only just start to have better days . totally understand . may i ask what make you stay on them for so long if you werent really get benefit from them ? have you ever hear of polydrugging ? its what doctor be good at , basically the first drug i get put on cause a symptom the docs think its real so give you another on top which cause another symptom until the patient doesnt know what be cause what , it never stop unless you end up be rush to hospital with a suspect stroke yes i totally understand that polydrugging after my doctor try to misdiagnose me for have arthritis . and try to give me drug for it . thank god i be aware of all the side effect n meds interactions . other wise i would of probably have all kinds of poop go on in my system . when i tell my doctor that she be wrong she couldnt believe that i say no to her arthritis meds . i bet . after all these decades that the ssris have be on the market you think they would know something . other than oh yoh will be find in two weeks . i guess they do not want to verbally scare their patients . with med drama . take me eight months . i know everyones chemistry be different . and iam still improve after be on them for roughly 3years . most definitely . both . oh my goodness it be and be the best feel ever . yes for 8full months . completely go . that be why i would never come off . can not risk that ant feel terrorize me again . i have be on citalopram a total of 7 months now , i be initially on 10mg , they increase me to 20mg and i stay on that for 5 . 5 months . i find that the 20mg seem much to high for me , it make me numb emotionally , and just felt weird so i reduce to 15mg , and so far and the past week i feel much more like my old self . so it be really a guess game as to the right dose , and how long it take to feel much better . you will have periods of feel better , and then a dip , then feel better , to where the dip happen rarely and the majority of time you feel good . do not get discourage if you have a dip just bare through it and tell yourself its temp and you be still on the path to feel better ! my doctor also tell me 6-8 weeks for full effect , that be so far from true for most people , most of the time . i would say you should start have some good days by then , and they will continue to increase for months , some people have say up to 7-8 months . so just give it time , stick with it . best wish ! i totally understand the adrenaline drama . i have that for 8months . it would start in my stomach and it would end on top of my head the most bizzare feel in the world . yes despair be definitely the correct definition . like omg what be happen why do i feel like this . etc . ah , the good old doctor advice again ...... . it may be that the meds reach their peak by 4-6 weeks i m not a medic so have no idea but that doesn t mean you will feel well by 4-6 weeks . these meds like all ssri s be slow work - it take me 6 months to feel better . no this be not your maximum - you have a long way to go yet . 4-6 weeks be really early . even though you may feel some improvement already , don t be fool , because usually recovery come and go - and that mean the symptoms come back time after time setbacks blips . this be completely normal and be just the way the meds work . so yes - you will keep improve , but as say , don t be too surprise if you start feel ill again . its perfectly normal . just keep go and those setbacks will finally cease to come . don t be in a rush either - let recovery come and go and you ll find over time you ll feel better and better . mwahahahahaha ...... me , celeb ? just an ordinary pleb lol . anxiety be a strange condition to have and its just as strange when recover , as it fox people into think they re not get better . but the meds be work despite how bad you might feel . glad you re feel some relief and yes , it should improve much more over time . let us know how it go . ps ...... . shall i send you my autograph hahaha . . . . there you go i have just see people go through what i do many moon ago . . . think the same , go down the wrong path , feel the same feel . . . . . so just like to lend a hand and pass on what i learn as i recover . yes the anxiety will come and go , and seem for no reason . its actually your reaction to it that count - freak about it , try and run away , try and stop it and it will just cling all the more - but let it be , work with it , take it with you however bad it feel , acknowledge it and do not start analyse it then it will lose its power and ease off . its not easy , but thats the way forward . also do not overdo things - when you have get anxiety it mean your body have reach its overload with stress and your body be tire , so as you recover take things easy , slow yourself down and be gentle on yourself . yes your mindset will change a lot - when you be have good time your body will feel calm and your thoughts light and lift - then when anxiety hit you it seem all you have felt yesterday have go out the window today as you feel frighten , think negative thoughts and can not see a way forward . its just anxiety that bring these effect with it - so an anxious body an anxious mind and a calm body a calm mind . one more thing - do not hope tomorrow be a good day , because if it be not then you will feel even more disappoint and frustrate . instead accept whatever come and just know that the anxiety will pass . . . . . maybe tomorrow , maybe next week or the week after . let it come and go as it please . anxiety be always worse in the mornings - apparently its to do with cortisol be at its highest first thing when wake . bad mornings and calmer even be exactly how recovery work for me - by the even i d feel a little calmer , and over time i begin to look forward to my even as they get better . those good feel gradually creep into more into my day so i d start feel more at ease earlier and earlier - and around 6 months i finally start wake with no anxiety . throughout that time i still have blips where i felt rubbish all day , but those days pass . yes it be tire - its always 3 step forward and 2 step back ... all the way . you will get better - just let recovery come to you - it will . hi potatoghost just be read your initial post and be wonder whether your doctor start you on 40mg or whether you have increase to 40mg . it seem such a high dose if that be what you have start on . in either case it may be worth discuss with your doctor whether a dose adjustment may suit you better . have you ask the doctor for a short term benzo ? ? i call it impend doom , at one point i be terrify of everything , scar to snap a bar of dark chocolate seriously i have be like that many months , it do ease hi high blood pressure meds be good for folks who have speak to an audience anxiety or who have heart palpitations . but too add a high blood pressure med to mental issue be ludicrous . how ling where you on mirt . ? totally agree with you . honestly i can still only watch certain things as some trigger me , how long be you on mirtazapine for ? yes i agree , i have come off mirt 3 time the first 2 be easy the last time be hell it last only 4 months , also from what i have read on here some people cit withdrawal sound less severe than others i have read elsewhere i literally have 100s of symptoms , just show how everyone be different you have to remember every time you fiddle with the dose be like start the process all over again for most folks . do not be afraid to take your benzo your doctor prescribe . why suffer ? i have be in withdrawal in one form or another fir nearly 2 years , add meds and change dose will mess with your cns so be careful i know for a fact the benzo will not make you depress . i would be more worry about change meds or increase meds . hi potatoghost i have a mirtazapine withdrawal support group on facebook bingo i tell you one thing without that benzo i would of end in a mental institution . at first they wouldnt give it to me after five months of suffer they finally approve my benzo . only use it for one year . the lowest dose . i just stop take it one day no withdrawl no drama for me . not anymore docs here in the uk rarely give them out as theyre so addictive even short term , i have 42 untouched diazepam i wont take them as take them for 5 days and have terrible withdrawals for months also they make you feel down when theyre wear off , of course everyone be different but personally its a no from me ! also cns be your central nervous system well i be dam . then you should already know the benzo do not give depression . bite the bullet and do not suffer . thank goodness i do not have an addictive personality . i can not even drink a glass of wine . lol if i drink i want to sleep . lol
